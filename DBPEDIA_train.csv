"Lions is the sixth studio album by American rock band The Black Crowes. It was released in 2001 as their first album on V2 Records following their departure from Columbia, and is their only studio album to feature guitarist Audley Freed. Lions was recorded in New York City in January and February of that year, and was produced by Don Was. Bass guitar duties were shared by Rich Robinson and Was, as Greg Rzab had left the band and was not replaced until the tour that followed the release of the album. The album debuted on the Billboard 200 at its peak position of 20, selling more than 53,000 copies in its first week. Lions received mixed reviews; although the overall sound of the album generally garnered praise, a frequent complaint was the lack of \""memorable\"" songs. The critics who rated Lions lowest considered it a poor imitation of the band's influences, such as Led Zeppelin. The band supported Lions with two North American tours (one with Oasis co-headlining), and a short tour of Europe and Japan in between. Soundboard recordings of several concerts were available for download to those who owned the album. Following the tour, the band went on hiatus until 2005.",Work,MusicalWork,Album

"The Princeton University Chapel is located on that university's main campus in Princeton, New Jersey, United States. It replaces an older chapel that burned down in 1920. Designed in 1921 by Ralph Adams Cram in his signature Collegiate Gothic style, it was built by the university between 1924 and 1928 at a cost of $2.3 million. Martin Luther King, Jr., delivered a sermon there in 1960. The chapel was rededicated in an interfaith ceremony in 2002 following a major two-year restoration. Its size and design evoke a small cathedral of the English Middle Ages. The only university chapel of its size at the time it was built was King's College Chapel at the University of Cambridge. The foundation is poured concrete, and the superstructure is sandstone and limestone. The main sanctuary consists of a narthex, a gallery, a nave, two transepts joined by a crossing, and an elevated choir. The chapel's extensive iconography consists of stained glass, stonemasonry, and wood carvings. Among the stained glass are four \""great windows\"", one facing each cardinal direction, and four \""Christian epic\"" windows in the walls of the choir. The iconography was planned by Albert M. Friend, a faculty member in Princeton's Department of Art and Archaeology, with the goal of portraying, in one scholar's words, a \""synthesis between Christian faith and modern thought.\"" The chapel seats almost 2,000 people. A nondenominational chapel, it hosts weekly ecumenical Christian services and daily Catholic Masses.

"A spruce is a tree of the genus Picea /paɪˈsiːə/, a genus of about 35 species of coniferous evergreen trees in the Family Pinaceae, found in the northern temperate and boreal (taiga) regions of the earth. Spruces are large trees, from about 20–60 metres (about 60–200 feet) tall when mature, and can be distinguished by their whorled branches and conical form. The needles, or leaves, of spruce trees are attached singly to the branches in a spiral fashion, each needle on a small peg-like structure. The needles are shed when 4–10 years old, leaving the branches rough with the retained pegs (an easy means of distinguishing them from other similar genera, where the branches are fairly smooth). Spruces are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (moth and butterfly) species; see list of Lepidoptera that feed on spruces. They are also used by the larvae of gall adelgids (Adelges species).

The shortest trail route to the summit of Eisenhower is from a parking lot on Mount Clinton Road, to its westnorthwest, via primarily the Edmands Path. Several routes are available from points more or less southwest of it on Route 302; the most used of these (probably roughly equal in popularity to the Edmands route) is via the Crawford Path, starting from a parking lot on Mount Clinton Road, very near 302 and just north of the Highland Center in the Crawford Notch area.

"Alhaji Mohammed Dabo Lere (born 1940) is a Nigerian politician who was elected Governor of Kaduna State, Nigeria between January 1992 and November 1993 during the Nigerian Third Republic, leaving office after the military coup that brought General Sani Abacha to power. Dabo Lere was of Hausa-Fulani origin. He was born into the Lere royal family on March 15, 1940 in Lere town Lere Local Government Area in Kaduna State. He was elected Governor of Kaduna State in December 1991 on the National Republican Convention (NRC) platform, with James Bawa Magaji as his running mate.In February 1992 there was violence between the mainly Muslem Hausa and mainly Christian Kataf communities of the Zangon-Kataf Local Government Area, with over 60 people killed. What most people do not seem to understand about the conflict is question is that not all Hausa people are Muslims, likewise the Kataf ethnicity has a tiny fraction that belongs to the Islam. One has to be very careful before one points accusing finger on one religion regarding religious conflicts entirely in Nigeria. Instead, the one factor to blame is nothing other than ignorance and unemployment in Nigeria. Dabo Lere set up a 7-person judicial committee to investigate the crisis, but neither side was satisfied.On 15 May 1992 there was a further outbreak of violence in Zangon-Kataf, and after news spread to Kaduna there was further violence in reprisal from both sides. It is embarrassing that rich people from both parties assisted their youths with weapons in order to fight the people they refer as enemies. Dabo Lere eventually made a broadcast at 7 p.m. on 17 May, calling for a curfew, which was ignored. After four days, calm returned when President Ibrahim Babangida ordered a dusk-to-dawn curfew and rushed in army troops and riot police from other states. In 2001, Dabo Lere led the supporters of Ibrahim Babangida in the North. Dabo Lere died of a stroke in Abuja on 18 February 2002, aged 64.",Agent,Person,OfficeHolder

"The Del-Vetts were an American garage rock band formed in Chicago, Illinois, in 1963. They released five singles and obtained regional success in the Midwest. The first lineup of the band consisted of Jim Lauer (lead vocals, lead guitar), Bob Good (bass guitar), Lester Goldboss (rhythm guitar) and Paul Wade (drums), originally performing cover versions of Chuck Berry songs and surf rock standards, and developing a loyal following in Chicago. The Del-Vetts' initial membership was not the most well-known incarnation of the band, though they did team up with record producer, Bill Traut, in 1965, to record a rendition of The Righteous Brothers' hit, \""Little Latin Lupe Lu\"", on the small Seeburg Records label. Within a year of performing regularly at popular teen dance clubs such as the Cellar and the Rolling Stone, a solidified lineup emerged, and included Lauer, Good, who swapped to rhythm guitar, Jack Burchall (bass guitar) and Roger Deatherage (drums). Despite the lack of commercial success resulting from their debut, Traut still felt the band could reach a breakthrough. He signed The Del-Vetts to a recording contract with Dunwich Records, and recorded their most commercially successful, and best known song, \""Last Time Around\"", an original composition by colleague Dennis Delquivist, in early 1966. The song, with a fuzz-toned guitar instrumental performed by Lauer acting as the highlight, was released as the band's second single, and scaled the regional charts to become the most-requested track on Chicago radio stations. However, their later in the year follow-up effort, \""I Call My Baby STP\"", underperformed and could not reach the same success as \""Last Time Around\"". In 1967, the group changed its name to The Pride and Joy and released the single \""Girl\"", a regional hit, and moved to Acta Records after a corporate restructuring at Dunwich. The group's last single was \""We Got a Long Way to Go\"", written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil; when it failed to chart at radio, Burchall left the group, and The Pride and Joy broke up in 1968.

"Afghanistan Liberation Organization (Persian: سازمان رهایی افغانستان‎‎, Sazman-i Rihayi Afghanistan, ALO) is a Maoist political group in Afghanistan. It was founded by Dr. Faiz Ahmad and some others in 1973. ALO is one of several organization that grew out of the Sholaye Javid (Eternal Flame) movement. ALO was originally named Revolutionary Group of the Peoples of Afghanistan (گروه انقلابی خلقهای افغانستان, RGPA); it was renamed in 1980. It was highly critical of the Soviet war in Afghanistan and actively fought against what it considered social imperialism. In June 1979, RGPA convened the Mujahedin Freedom Fighters Front of Afghanistan together with Islamist elements, as a united front against the pro-Soviet government. Along with some other Islamist groups, RGPA directed an uprising in Kabul and other cities on August 5, 1979, that became known as the Bala Hissar uprising. The uprising was suppressed by the government and tens of ALO cadres were killed and arrested. Some of the central committee members like Mohammad Mohsin, Mohammad Dawod and others were executed in the Pul-e-Charkhi prison. ALO had many fronts against the Soviets and pro-Soviet Afghan communists in different parts of Afghanistan and was attacked by both the Soviet forces and the fundamentalist groups of Mujahideen. They lost over 120 of its cadres during the war. Dr. Faiz Ahmad himself was assassinated on November 12, 1986 along with his 6 other comrades by the Hizb-e Islami militia of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. More recently, ALO has directed its energies towards opposing the American occupation of Afghanistan and the regime of President Hamid Karzai.",Agent,Organisation,PoliticalParty

"Ahmad Bourghani Farahani (in Persian: احمد بورقانی فراهانی; January 2, 1960 – February 2, 2008) was an influential Iranian reformist politician, notable journalist, writer and political analyst. Bourghani was deputy minister of culture of Iran in President Mohammad Khatami's cabinet. He was also head of IRNA in United Nations as well as member of Iranian parliament. Bourghani received his bachelor's degree in geography from Shahid Beheshti University of Tehran. He entered journalism after the victory of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. During the Iran–Iraq war, he oversaw the War Information Press, and was chief news manager of the IRNA. From 1990 to 1993, he was posted in New York City as the UN correspondent for IRNA. Upon returning, he helped establish the short-lived weeklies Bahar, Barharan and Envoy. During his brief tenure as vice-minister of Culture, Ahmad Bourghani oversaw the issuance of hundreds of press permits and the flowering of an independent Iranian press for the first time since 1979. He had a significant role in the development of journalism in post-revolution Iran. Following the initial attacks on the reformist press, Iran's conservatives tried to undercut the reformist press by reactivating the Press Court. Bourghani stood up in the Court in front of the young presiding judge, Saeed Mortazavi, and defended the freedom of the press. Mortazavi, the nephew of Ayatollah Yazdi, was trying to force Bourghani and Khatami's government to shut down the Jame'eh newspaper but when Bourghani refused to do so, he himself ordered to shut down the newspaper. After the closure of Jame'eh and Tous in the summer of 1998, a second crop of independent dailies appeared in late 1998. These papers exposed Intelligence Ministry agents' involvement in the political assassinations of reformist intellectuals and activists in late 1998. Bourghani, chosen by Khatami, to spearhead the liberalization of the public sphere, resigned in February 1999, frustrated with the intransigence of the Commission for the Supervision of the Press (a joint committee of representatives of the three branches of government and the press that reviews press application and thus determines who can and cannot publish), and dismayed by lukewarm support from his own minister, Ata'ollah Mohajerani, who narrowly survived a parliamentary impeachment motion in May for \""cultural laxity\"". Two years later, he was elected as representative of Tehran to Majlis of Iran, The Iranian Parliament. As a Member of Iranian Parliament, he persuaded his goal for the freedom of the press in Iran and was one of the key people in debating the Reform of the Press laws. Shortly after, Ayatollah Khamenei sent a letter to the parliament demanding that the debate stop. Ahmad Bourghani was also the president of the Parliamentary Friendship Group between Italy and Iran. He was also the organizer of \""Iran, hundred years after Iranian constitutional revolution\"", an international conference organized in Tehran (2007). Bourghani died in a Tehran hospital of a heart attack at the age of 48.",Agent,Politician,President

"\""Bonzo Goes to Bitburg\"" is a song by American punk rock band the Ramones. It was issued as a single in the UK by Beggars Banquet Records in mid-1985. The song is an emotionally charged commentary on the Bitburg controversy from earlier that year, in which U.S. president Ronald Reagan had paid a state visit to a German World War II cemetery where numerous Waffen-SS soldiers were buried. Lyrically, the song was a departure from the usual Ramones topics, and it became a major critical success for the band. The 1985 single did not receive an American release. As an import, however, the record became a hit on U.S. college radio. It was eventually retitled \""My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes to Bitburg)\"", and appeared on the band's album Animal Boy, released in 1986.

"The chestnut-capped brush finch (Arremon brunneinucha), is a passerine bird which breeds in highlands from central Mexico to south-eastern Peru. Despite its name, it is not a true finch, but rather a member of the large Emberizidae family, which also includes buntings, American sparrows, juncos and towhees. Until recently, it was generally placed in the genus Buarremon, while it occasionally has been placed in Atlapetes. This is a common bird in the undergrowth of wet mountain forests, second growth, and ravines at from 900 m to 250 m altitude. The nest, built by the female, is a large cup of plant material placed less than 2.5 m up in a shrub or small tree in dense scrub or a ravine. The typical clutch is two glossy, unmarked white or pale blue eggs, which are incubated by the female alone for 12–14 days before hatching. The chestnut-capped brush finch is a large, robust, mainly terrestrial species, 19 cm long and weighing 45 g. It has a long slender bill and large feet and legs. The adult has a distinctive head pattern, with a yellow-edged chestnut crown and nape, black forehead and head sides, white spots in the centre and each side of the forehead, and a white throat which is often puffed up when the bird is excited. The upperparts are dark olive, with darker wings. The white central breast is separated from the white throat by a black band. The breast sides are grey, and the flanks and lower belly are olive-green. Young birds have a sooty-brown cap, sooty face and olive-brown upperparts, throat and breast. The chestnut-capped brush finch has a thin pink call and a very high-pitched psssst. The male’s song consists of a mixture of whistles and sharper notes. The chestnut-capped brush finch feeds on insects and spiders extracted from the leaf litter with its bill, and will also pick berries and invertebrate prey from low bushes.

"Spelunx and the Caves of Mr. Seudo is an educational computer game intended for young children developed by Cyan (now Cyan Worlds) in 1991. It was designed by the brothers Robyn and Rand Miller (better known now as the creators of Myst). The game was programmed and implemented using HyperCard, with Robyn Miller hand-drawing all of the in-game graphics and scenery. The game's title was derived from the verb \""to spelunk\"", referring to the act of exploring caves. Although Spelunx contained a basic frame story (centered on the scientific endeavors of one Professor Spelunx and his willing assistant, Mr. Seudo), there was no other plot. As a game, it was intended to be explored and played with—like a toy—rather than completed or won. Although the characters Professor Spelunx and Mr. Seudo are mentioned (and even depicted in-game) the player never meets them. Spelunx was an early first-person point-and-click adventure game. It was structured as a collection of rooms connected by a series of underground tunnels (accessed via elevator). Each room contained interactive mini-games and experiments, most of which were designed to introduce the player to a specific field of knowledge. A hidden control panel within the game allowed for the rearrangement of the caves and other locations, and even allowed for the expansion of the caves with the addition of newer rooms. Although it was the intention of Cyan to continue releasing new rooms over time for players to explore, this never occurred. In 1993, following the release of Myst, Cyan produced a colorized version of Spelunx. Although the original monochrome version contained small amounts of color at specific locations or during specific events (utilizing MacroMind Player, a predecessor of Adobe Flash), this new version (colorized by artist Josh Staub) contained full-color scenery and animation (as well as a small easter egg: an image of Myst Island hidden within one of the original rooms). More recently, the color version has been ported to Windows and released on the Steam digital distribution service as part of the Cyan Complete Pack, alongside other early Cyan titles (including Myst).",Work,Software,VideoGame

She represented the Labor Party for the majority of her time in parliament, and was a minister in the Lawrence government, but resigned to sit as an independent in 1991. Buchanan was born in Perth to Doris May (née Brittain) and Walter Scott Slocombe. She attended Perth Girls' High School, and later went on to Perth Technical College. From 1967 to 1976, she was a preschool administrator in Roebourne, in the state's north-west, where she also ran an adult education centre for Aboriginals. A member of the Labor Party from 1976, from 1980 to 1982 Buchanan was an assistant in the Karratha office of Peter Dowding, a member of the Legislative Council for North Province and also a future premier. Later president of the party's Wickham branch, she ran for the seat of Pilbara at the 1983 state election, winning with 58.77% of the vote. She replaced the retiring Liberal member, Brian Sodeman, who had held the seat since 1974. Buchanan increased her majority to 64.67% at the 1986 election, after which she was made a government whip. At the 1989 election, Buchanan successfully transferred to the newly recreated seat of Ashburton, with her replacement in Pilbara, Larry Graham, retaining that seat for Labor. The re-elected Dowding government persisted only until February 1990, when it was replaced by the Lawrence government following Dowding's forced resignation. New premier Carmen Lawrence elevated Buchanan to the ministry as Minister for Works and Services and Minister for Regional Development. She was also made assistant minister to Lawrence in her capacity as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. However, the regional development portfolio was abolished in December 1990, and Buchanan lost her remaining portfolios in February 1991, as part of a ministerial reshuffle prompted by an internal spill motion. Jeff Carr and Gavan Troy were also removed as ministers, with Carr consequently resigning from parliament. Buchanan herself resigned to sit as an independent on 1 February 1991, before the new ministry was sworn in four days later. She consequently became the first woman in the Parliament of Western Australia to sit as an independent.

Based on an absolute magnitude of 15.4, the asteroid is calculated to measure between 2 and 5 kilometers in diameter, assuming an albedo in the range of 0.05 to 0.25. Since asteroids in the outer main-belt are mostly of a carbonaceous rather than of a silicaceous composition, with low albedos, typically around 0.06, the asteroid's diameter might be on the upper end of NASA's published conversion table, as the lower the body's reflectivity (albedo), the larger its diameter, for a given absolute magnitude (brightness). This minor planet is named for the Venezuelan town of Caripito in the northeastern Monagas State. It was the place where the parents of the discoverer, Thomas Baynes Dellinger (b. 1926) and María de la Garza Cantú (b. 1928), met in 1949. At the time, the town was a base camp for the country's rich Quiriquire oil field. Naming citation was published on 18 September 2005 (M.P.C. 54829).",Place,CelestialBody,Planet

"Big Lake Butte des Morts (/ˌbjuːdəˈmɔər/) is an 8,800-acre (36 km2) lake located in the U.S. state of Wisconsin and is part of the Winnebago Pool (also known as the Winnebago System). The lake is fed by the Fox River in the southwest and the Wolf River draining from Lake Winneconne in the northwest, and drains via the Fox River southeast into Lake Winnebago. The lake is also part of the Butte des Morts region in Winnebago County, Wisconsin. Much of the lake is flooded marshland created by the damming of the Fox River downstream in Menasha in the 19th century, which explains the lake's flat and shallow character (maximum depth is 15 ft). U.S. Highway 41 (US 41) / Interstate 41 (I41) spans the east end of the lake via a bridge and causeway combination. The bridge includes the Tribal Heritage Crossing, a designated national trail, which is a portion of the Wiouwash Trail. The city of Oshkosh lies between Lake Butte des Morts and Lake Winnebago. Big Lake Butte des Morts is popular among both fishermen and recreational boaters during the warm months, and with ice fishermen in the winter. A marked navigation channel helps passage across the lake from the inflow of the Wolf River to the west (connecting to Lake Poygan), to the outflow of the Fox River east to Lake Winnebago. While in the same general location, it is not connected to Little Lake Butte des Morts, a smaller lake to the north downstream of the Winnebago Pool. Big Lake Butte des Morts served as part of the Fox-Wisconsin Waterway. Fish species found in the lake include walleye, drum, white bass, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, carp, flathead and channel catfish, northern pike, crappie, yellow perch, bluegill and sturgeon. Sunset Point, located near the US 41 bridge, is one of the most popular walleye fishing spots on the Winnebago System.

He earned his greatest recognition after leading his army against Napoleon I at the Battle of the Nations at Leipzig in 1813 and the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Blücher was born in Rostock, the son of a retired army captain. His military career began in 1758 as a hussar in the Swedish Army. He was captured by the Prussians in 1760 during the Pomeranian Campaign and thereafter joined the Prussian Army, serving as a hussar officer for Prussia during the remainder of the Seven Years' War. In 1773, Blücher was forced to resign by Frederick the Great for insubordination. He worked as a farmer until the death of Frederick in 1786, when Blücher was reinstated and promoted to colonel. For his success in the French Revolutionary Wars, Blücher became a major general in 1794. He became a lieutenant general in 1801 and commanded the cavalry corps during the Napoleonic Wars in 1806. War broke out between Prussia and France again in 1813 and Blücher returned to active service at the age of 71. He was appointed full general over the Prussian field forces and clashed with Napoleon at the Battles of Lützen and Bautzen. Later he won a critical victory over the French at the Battle of Katzbach. Blücher commanded the Prussian Army of Silesia at the Battle of the Nations where Napoleon was decisively defeated. For his role, Blücher was made a field marshal and received his title of Prince of Wahlstatt. After Napoleon’s return in 1815, Blücher took command of the Prussian Army of the Lower Rhine and coordinated his force with that of the British and Allied forces under the Duke of Wellington. At the Battle of Ligny, he was severely injured and the Prussians retreated. After recovering, Blücher resumed command and joined Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo, with the intervention of Blücher's army playing a decisive role in the final allied victory. Blücher was made an honorary citizen of Berlin, Hamburg and Rostock. Known for his fiery personality, he was nicknamed Marschall Vorwärts (\""Marshal Forward\"") by his soldiers because of his aggressive approach in warfare.

"Yasa was a bhikkhu during the time of Gautama Buddha. He was the sixth bhikkhu in the Buddha’s sangha and was the sixth to achieve arahanthood. Yasa lived in the 6th century BCE in what is now Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in northern India. Yasa was raised in Varanasi in a life of luxury. His father was a millionaire. The family home was full of servants, musicians and dancers who catered for the family’s needs and entertainment. One day, when he had become a young man, Yasa awoke early and saw his female servants and entertainers asleep in a repulsive state. Disgusted by the spectacle, Yasa realised the vanity of worldly life, and left the family home muttering “Distressed am I, oppressed am I” and journeyed in the direction of Isipatana where the Buddha was temporarily residing after his first five bhikkhus had attained arahantship. This was five days after all of the first five bhikkhus had attained arahantship. The Buddha was pacing up and down in an open space near where Yasa was muttering “Distressed am I, oppressed am I”, and called Yasa over to him, inviting him to sit down. Yasa took off his golden sandals, saluted and sat down. The Buddha gave a dharma discourse, and Yasa achieved the first stage of arahanthood, sotapanna. At first, the Buddha spoke about generosity (Dana), morality (sila), celestial states (sagga), the evils of sensual pleasure (kamadinava), blessing of renunciation (nekkhammanisamsa), before teaching the Four Noble Truths. Yasa’s mother had noticed her son’s absence, and notified her husband, who sent horsemen in four directions to search for Yasa. Yasa’s father headed in the direction of Isipatana, following the trail left by the golden slippers. When the millionaire saw the Buddha and asked him if he had seen Yasa, the Buddha asked him to sit down, and then delivered a dharma talk. After this Yasa’s father became the first to take refuge in the Triple Gems, the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. Yasa, who was in the vicinity and had heard the talk given to his father, became an arahant. After father and son were reunited, the father invited the Buddha and the Sangha to his home for alms on the following day. The Buddha then ordained Yasa. The Buddha and his six arahants visited the home of Yasa the following day. Yasa’s mother and his former wife thus became the first two female lay disciples. Upon hearing of Yasa's ordination, four of his closest friends, Vimala, Subahu, Punnaji and Gavampati followed him into the sangha and they too became arahants. Within two months, a further fifty of Yasa's friends had joined the Sangha and attained arahantship, bringing the total number of arahants to sixty.",Agent,Person,Religious

"The Socialist Democracy of Guinea (French: Démocratie Socialiste de Guinée, DSG) was a political party in Guinea. DSG was founded in the run-up to the 1954 legislative election by Abdoulaye Diallo, Chaikou Baldé and Ibrahima Barry (aka 'Barry III'). DSG was a continuation of the party led by Yaciné Diallo. DSG was the Guinean affiliate of the French Section of the Workers International (SFIO). Barry III was the candidate of the party in the election. Barry III came third in the 1954 election with 16,098 votes (6.3%). The French colonial administration was opposed to DSG. The French administration hoped to thwart the radical African Democratic Rally (RDA) of Sékou Touré, and with this purpose they propped up the conservative African Bloc of Guinea (BAG, a party tied to Fula chiefs). The administration did not wish that any other party that would rival BAG as the anti-RDA force in Guinea, thus disapproving of the emergence of DSG. At its July 1954 congress SFIO charged that the French governor in Guinea had openly supported the BAG candidate, in contradiction to the neutrality that an administrative official should have adhered to. However, when there was a vote in the French National Assembly on validating the Guinean election result, SFIO voted in favour validation. DSG mobilized educated, modernist Fulas. It was never able to become a mass party, and its influence was largely limited to the Futa Jalon. Barry III's attacks on traditional chiefs alienated large parts of the Fula population away from the party. DSG published the bimonthly Le Populaire de Guinée. DSG held its first congress in Dixinn November 20–22, 1955. In the 1956 legislative election, DSG obtained 9.8% of the vote in Guinea. In the municipal elections held the same year, DSG won in Dalaba and Labé. In January 1957, DSG became an affiliate of the African Socialist Movement (MSA).

"The Institutional Democratic Party (Spanish: Partido Institucional Democrática, PID) was a Guatemalan pro-government political party active during the 1970s. The PID was formed in 1963 by Enrique Peralta Azurdia after he had seized power in a coup. A centre-right party, it was modelled on the Mexican Institutional Revolutionary Party. From the onset the party was dominated by the country's military elite. Despite this the party maintained close links with individual civilian parties during its existence, with their civilian allies often outnumbering them in the Assembly. The PID was first tested in the 1966 general election when the leader of the Revolutionary Party of Guatemala, Mario Mendez Montenegro agreed to support the PID. However he died not long before the vote and his brother Julio César Méndez Montenegro took over in his place. A supporter of reform, he split from the PID and won the election overwhelmingly. However his Presidency was blighted by violence from the far-right National Liberation Movement (MLN) and the PID formed an alliance with this group for the 1970 election, resulting in the success of their candidate Carlos Manuel Arana Osorio. In the 1974 general election they were again supported by the MLN and their joint candidate Kjell Eugenio Laugerud García secured the Presidency. However this election saw cracks appear in the PID as all three candidates were leading military officers who would thus have been expected to support the party. These became more acute following the 1976 Guatemala earthquake at a time when Laugerud was involved in a feud with Arana Osorio over control of the National Reconstruction Committee. Ultimately Laugerud put a block on Arana Osorio's activity by bringing one of his closest aides to trial for organising death squads, despite the fact that Laugerud had been involved in the same practice. In the 1978 general election the PID aligned with the Revolutionary Party to secure the election of Fernando Romeo Lucas García. However, after this victory internal divisions within the party continued to escalate, whilst from the outside the business community began to grow as more vocal critics, particularly over the issue of PID operatives using their positions to enrich themselves. When plans to rig upcoming elections for the PID candidate came to light the military opposition took action by overthrowing Lucas Garcia and installing Efraín Ríos Montt as President. As a result, a new generation of young officers replaced the old and the PID did not continue after the coup. The party won 5 seats in the Constituent Assembly elections in 1984. For the 1985 elections, the PID and MLN renewed their alliance and backed Mario Sandoval Alarcón as presidential candidate, finishing fourth in the presidential race while becoming the third largest block in Congress. A rump PID emerged in 1990 when it merged with the Guatemalan Republican Front (FRG) and the National Unity Front to run for election as the No Sell-Out Platform, although this alliance quickly became dominated by the FRG.",Agent,Organisation,PoliticalParty

"The Siege of Malta, also known as the Siege of Valletta or the French Blockade (Maltese: L-Imblokk tal-Franċiżi), was a two-year siege and blockade of the French garrison in Valletta, the largest city and main port on the Mediterranean island of Malta, between 1798 and 1800. Valletta had been captured by a French expeditionary force during the Mediterranean campaign of 1798, and garrisoned with 3,000 men under the command of Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois. When the French Mediterranean Fleet was destroyed at the Battle of the Nile on 1 August 1798, the British Royal Navy was able to initiate a blockade of Malta, assisted by an uprising among the native Maltese population against French rule. Forced to retreat to Valletta, the French garrison faced severe food shortages, exacerbated by the effectiveness of the British blockade: although small quantities of supplies arrived in early 1799, there was no further traffic until early 1800, by which time starvation and disease was having a disastrous effect on health, morale, and combat capability of the French troops. In February 1800, a significant convoy under Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Perrée sent from Toulon made a determined effort to resupply the garrison. The blockade squadron under Rear-Admiral Lord Nelson intercepted the convoy within sight of the starving troops on Malta and in the ensuing, but brief, battle, Perrée was killed and his flagship captured. The following month, the ship of the line Guillaume Tell set sail from Valletta to Toulon, laden with soldiers, but this too was intercepted and in a hard-fought battle was forced to surrender to a larger British squadron. These defeats rendered the French position on Valletta untenable, and its surrender inevitable. Although Vaubois held out for another five months, he eventually surrendered on 4 September, by which time the garrison mortality from malnourishment and typhus had reached 100 men a day. Malta was retained by Britain, and control of the island was a factor in the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803. Ultimately it remained under British government for 164 years, gaining independence in 1964.",Event,SocietalEvent,MilitaryConflict

"Nothobranchiidae are a family of bony fishes containing roughly 300 species. They are small killifish, usually measuring about 5 centimetres (2.0 in). They are limited to Africa, and were formerly included in the family Aplocheilidae (that family is now limited to Malagasy and Asian species, and the single West African Pseudepiplatys annulatus). They live in fresh water but are somewhat salt-tolerant. They are also found in muddy or brackish water. Some species are kept as aquarium pets. They have frilly fins and many are brightly colored. Members of genus Nothobranchius are found in mud pools on the plains of Africa, a habitat shared by no other fish except the lungfishes. Their life cycle is only a year long – and they die when the pools dry up, however the species survive because their eggs remain inactive (in diapause) in the dry bottom substrate throughout the dry season. (This is not true for lungfish, which are capable of surviving seasonal drying out of their habitats by burrowing into mud and estivating throughout the dry season. They can live to be at least 80 years of age.) Pools of this type are often sprayed with poison to reduce mosquito populations, which also kills the fish. As might be expected with short-lived species living in an ephemeral habitat, many of these fish reach sexual maturity within weeks of hatching, and are prolific breeders. Nothobranchius furzeri is the shortest-living vertebrate that can be bred in captivity, having a lifespan of between three and nine months. Nothobranchius furzeri needs much food because it grows quickly, so when food supplied is inadequate, bigger fish will eat the smaller fish.",Species,Animal,Fish
"Tanyus Shahin Saadeh al-Rayfouni (also spelled Tanios Chahine Saadé Al Rayfouné, given name also spelled Taniyus or Tanius) (1815–1895) was a Maronite muleteer and peasant leader from Mount Lebanon. He led a peasants' revolt in the area of Keserwan in 1859, during which he drove out the area's Maronite nobility, the feudal Khazen lords, and declared a peasants' republic. While he had a reputation as a ruffian and provocateur among members of the Maronite clergy and European consuls, Shahin became a popular figure among Christian commoners, many of whom considered him the guardian of their interests, a view which Shahin promoted. Following his victory in Keserwan, Shahin and his fighters launched intermittent raids against villages in nearby regions, such as Jubail and Matn, often in the name of defending the rights of local Christians. The assaults and their repercussions served as catalysts of the 1860 Mount Lebanon civil war, particularly the battle of Beit Mery between local Maronites and Druze, in which Shahin was a principal belligerent. Although he claimed he could raise an army of 50,000 to combat the forces of the Druze feudal lords, he did not participate further in the war. Following the war's end, he was defeated by Youssef Karam in a struggle over political influence in Maronite affairs.

Bone marrow transplantation and high-dose cytoreductive chemotherapy have both been identified as risk factors for infections with this organism. These patients are often neutropenic for extended periods of time, leaving them susceptible to bacterial and fungal infections, including Candidal infections. Some investigators have theorized that the widespread use of Amphotericin B empiric antifungal therapy selects for infections with Candida lusitaniae.",Species,Eukaryote,Fungus

"The yellow-casqued hornbill (Ceratogymna elata), also known as the yellow-casqued wattled hornbill, is found in the rainforest of coastal regions of West Africa, for example in Côte d'Ivoire. The yellow-casqued hornbill is one of the largest birds of the West African forest, with adults weighing up to 2 kg (4.4 lb). They live mainly in the forest canopy, rarely feeding on the ground. They live in small family groups containing at least one adult male and female, with one or two immature birds, though they sometimes gather in larger flocks to exploit a major food supply such as an ant or termite nest. The birds are occasionally preyed upon by crowned hawk-eagles, and they respond to the presence of an eagle (sometimes indicated by its characteristic shriek) by mobbing – approaching it and emitting calls. Since the eagles depend on surprise to make a catch, this frequently causes them to leave the area. Recent research (Rainey et al., 2004) has shown that the birds respond in the same way to the alarm calls that Diana monkeys, which live in the same areas, emit if they notice an eagle, and that they can distinguish the calls made by the monkeys in the presence of eagles from those they make in the presence of leopards, which prey on the monkeys but not on the hornbills.",Species,Animal,Bird

"In Greek mythology, Aspalis (Ἁσπαλίς) was a local heroine from Melite in Phthia whose story was apparently meant to provide an etiology for the local surname and cult of Artemis. As in certain Artemis mythology, she hanged herself and her body disappeared. The exact story of Aspalis, known from Antoninus Liberalis, is as follows. Melite was once ruled by a tyrant so cruel that the citizens dared not pronounce his real name, dubbing him Tartarus. He would order for the most beautiful girls to be brought to him and made them his concubines against their will. When he sent for Aspalis, daughter of Argaeus, the girl hanged herself rather than be violated. Her brother Astygites swore to avenge her death before her body would be taken out of the noose. He put on his sister's clothes, hiding a sword underneath, and in this disguise got into the tyrant's palace and killed him. The citizens threw the tyrant's body into a river which from that circumstance became known as Tartarus, and crowned Astygites with a wreath to express gratitude to him. As they were going to give burial to Aspalis, they found that her body had disappeared, but a wooden statue of Artemis was discovered on the spot. It became a cult object, and was referred to as \""Aspalis Ameilete Hekaerge\""; а young she-goat was sacrificed to the goddess every year via being hanged by the city maidens, this being a ritual imitation of Aspalis' suicide. Aspalis was speculated to have originally been a western Semitic hunting goddess identified with Artemis.",Agent,FictionalCharacter,MythologicalFigure

"Sombrero Key Light is located near Key Vaca in Marathon, Florida. The lighthouse is located on a mostly submerged reef. The name Sombrero Key goes back to the Spanish, and old charts show a small island at the spot, but by the later 19th Century the island had eroded away, with some parts of the reef exposed at low tide. As a result, the reef and the lighthouse have also been called Dry Banks. The lighthouse was put in service in 1858, automated in 1960, and is still in operation. The foundation is iron pilings with disks, and the tower is a skeletal octagonal pyramid of cast iron. It is a 142-foot (43 m) tall brown painted tower. It has two platforms.

The river occupies a trench arching from southwest to northeast across the southern part of Cape Breton County; much of the eastern part of the river is a tidal estuary, with noticeable tides extending beyond Albert Bridge approximately 10 km (6.2 mi) upstream of the Gut. The river's width and calm waters make it ideal for pleasure boating and other recreational activities; numerous cottages line its banks. Several campgrounds and parks, along with the Mira Boat Club at Albert Bridge make the Mira River a vacation destination in the Cape Breton Regional Municipality. Popular swimming spots include Marion Bridge, Mira Gut Beach, Sanagree Island, Mira Water Park, and Albert Bridge. The Mira region is also home to the Two Rivers Wildlife Park. According to estimates by the Province of Nova Scotia, there are 102,428 people resident within the Mira/Salmon River watershed in 2011. The Mira River was the inspiration for local singer-songwriter Allister MacGillivray's Song for the Mira. Over the years, it has become a renowned folk song, that has been recorded by many artists and translated into several different languages. The mouth of the river, which drains into Mira Gut, is spanned by a bridge with a revolving middle span. This bridge, along with Albert Bridge, have been known to be used as diving boards by youths seeking adventure. The activity has not been as prevalent in recent years due to public fears of injury and liability, and to threats made by the Cape Breton Regional Police of fines or jail time for jumpers. The Gut bridge was used due to the high currents experienced at mid tide. Albert Bridge was used due to its height above water and the deep pool situated below the northwestern end of the bridge.",Place,Stream,River

"The Invasion of Banu Qurayza took place in the Dhul Qa‘dah during February and March of 627 AD (5 AH). The Banu Qurayza initially told the Muslims that they were allied to them during the Battle of the Trench, however, later they sided with the Pagan Arabs of Quraysh and their allies. According to traditional sources, Jewish leaders organized efforts against Muhammad and the Muslims. Three Jewish leaders from the tribe of Banu al-Nadir, three Jewish leaders from the tribe of Wa'il, and various other Jewish groups and leaders united and pressured Banu Qurayza to betray their agreement to Muhammad. Afzalur Rahman states that during the Battle of the Trench, when the Muslims were surrounded by a large hostile force, the Banu Qurayza joined the enemies of the Muslims and threatened the Muslims from within the town itself. Waqidi claims that Muhammad had a treaty with the tribe which was torn apart. Norman Stillman and Watt believe such a treaty was \""doubtful\"" to have existed, though Watt believes the Qurayza had agreed not to assist Muhammad's enemies against him. According to Mubrakpuri, Peters, Stillman, Guillaume, Inamdar and Ibn Kathir, on the day of the Meccans' withdrawal Muhammad led his forces against Banu Qurayza. According to Muslim tradition he had been ordered to do so by God. The Banu Qurayza, a Jewish tribe, were besieged for 25 days until they surrendered. According to Mohammed al-Ghazali, during that time the Muslims allowed the Jews who had refused to betray the Prophet during the Battle of the Ditch to leave and \""go wherever they wished\"". Sa'd ibn Mu'adh, a companion of Muhammad, was chosen by him as an arbiter and all parties agreed to abide by his judgment. Sa'd gave his verdict that \""the men should be killed, the property divided, and the women and children taken as captives\"". Muhammad approved of the ruling, calling it similar to God's judgment, after which nearly all male members of the tribe who had reached puberty were beheaded The Muslim jurist Tabari quotes 600–900 being executed. The Sunni hadith do not give the number killed, but state that all post-pubescent males were killed and one woman. According to Ibn Kathir, Quranic verses 33:26-27 and 33:9-10 are about the attack against the Banu Qurayza. Researcher, W. N. Arafat places doubt on the description of events described by Ibn Ishaq (which was used later by Tabari as his sole source). Arafat states in regards to the reception of Ibn Ishaq's and Tabari's account: \""The attitude of scholars and historians to Ibn lshaq's version of the story has been either one of complacency, sometimes mingled with uncertainty, or at least in two important cases, one of condemnatlon and outright rejection.\"" Ibn Ishaq was criticized by Sunni scholar, Malik ibn Anas as being \""a liar\"" and somebody \""who transmits his stories from the Jews.\""",Event,SocietalEvent,MilitaryConflict

"You Don't Know Jack is the 2011 release of the trivia-based party game series You Don't Know Jack. The game was developed by Jellyvision Games and published by THQ, and was released in North America on February 8, 2011, for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo DS, PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360 platforms. It is the first title in the series released by Jellyvision after an eight-year hiatus, taking advantage of online connectivity and other features of modern gaming consoles. A single player iOS port was released about two months later, but was later pulled in anticipation of a more robust client based on the Facebook version of the game. The game is structured around a fictional game show emceed by Cookie Masterson (voiced by Tom Gottlieb), in which the players answer ten multiple-choice questions, and then compete in a final \""Jack Attack\"" round. Answering quickly and correctly earns virtual money to track the players' scores, while incorrect answers are penalized. As per the game's motto, \""the irreverent trivia party game\"", the questions often combine general knowledge with popular culture references and verbal wordplay to determine the correct answer. Unlike the earlier releases which randomly presented questions, the 2011 game provides more than 73 episodes with a predefined set of questions, and with further episodes to be made available as downloadable content which is currently only available on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 through both consoles' respective online stores.

"New Mexico chile (or New Mexican chile) is a group of cultivars of the chile pepper, initially developed by pioneer horticulturist, Dr. Fabián Garcia, at New Mexico State University in 1894, then known as Las Cruces College and the New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts. Selective breeding began with 14 lineages of 'Pasilla', 'Colorado', and 'Negro' cultivars, from across New Mexico and Southern Colorado's old Hispano and Pueblo communities. These peppers were selected to have a \""larger smoother, fleshier, more tapering and shoulderless pod for canning purposes.\"" The first cultivar of this group was released in 1913, called 'New Mexico No. 9'. The New Mexico chile peppers are popular in the cuisine of the Southwestern United States and in the broader Mexican cuisine, and an integral staple of New Mexican cuisine. Chile grown in the Hatch Valley, in and around Hatch, New Mexico, is called Hatch chile, but no one type of chile is specific to that area, which is smaller than the acreage used to produce chiles with the \""Hatch\"" label. The peppers grown in the valley, and along the entire Rio Grande, from northern Taos Pueblo to southern Isleta Pueblo, are a signature crop to New Mexico's economy and culture. The chile pepper is New Mexico's state vegetable, and the official New Mexico state question is \""Red or Green?\"". The New Mexico green chile pepper flavor has been described as lightly pungent similar to an onion, or like garlic with a subtly sweet, spicy, crisp, and smoky taste. The ripened red retains the flavor, but adds an earthiness and bite while aging mellows the front-heat and delivers more of a back-heat. The spiciness depends on the variety of New Mexico chile peppers.",Species,Plant,CultivatedVariety

"Lace webbed spider is a name given to two common species of house spiders of the genus Amaurobius; A. similis and A. fenestralis. The spiders are often found near windows, hence the Latin root of the name A. fenestralis, with A. similis later defined as a separate, but similar, species, and being named accordingly. Lace webbed spiders vary in body size from 7 mm to 12 mm, with large, strong legs. While the species are similar, with the young virtually indistinguishable, A. similis tends to be larger and darker in colouration when an adult, and prefers the indoors. The smaller, lighter A. fenestralis is rarely found inside, and is often observed on outside walls, or on trees, especially under loose bark. Both species have V-shaped markings on their abdomens, with A. fenestralis having two or three of these, and A. similis usually having four. For precise identification, spider genitalia may need to be checked for characteristic differences in the species. All members of the family Amaurobiidae are nocturnal, and their bluish silk, woven into a funnel, is combed into a frayed texture with a calamistrum, a row of stiff hairs on the rear legs. Much like Velcro, the barbed hooks of insects get caught in the furry web, allowing the catching of much larger prey than the spider itself. Around the second year of life, Amaurobiidae spiders lay an average of 40 eggs in a breeding chamber spun of silk, where the mother will protect the eggs until hatching. When the young are born, they will consume their egg yolk, and then devour their mother before emerging from the chamber.",Species,Animal,Arachnid

"Arkansas Times, a weekly alternative newspaper based in Little Rock, Arkansas, is a publication that has circulated for nearly 40 years, originally as a magazine. Its current format stems from reaction to the Arkansas Democrat's buyout of assets from Gannett's closure of the Arkansas Gazette in 1991, which had resulted in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Arkansas Times ' senior editor, Max Brantley, is among those former Gazette staffers who lost their jobs as a result of the merger. He was the first editor of the weekly edition in May 1992. The Gazette's editorial cartoonist, George Fisher, became the Times cartoonist until his death. Billed as Arkansas's weekly newspaper of politics and culture (similarly styled as other regional publications like The Memphis Flyer), Arkansas Times is noted for its opinion columnists and feature articles that take a decidedly liberal stance in comparison to the larger, daily Democrat-Gazette. Over the years since its founding, the publication's parent company — Arkansas Times Limited Partnership — has gone on to produce a number of special inserts and associated publications. Among these are the weekly El Latino, a Spanish-language weekly. The company also publishes Savvy Kids, a family magazine; the quarterly Arkansas Wild about outdoor pursuits and Arkansas Food and Farm, a periodical that reports on small farm agriculture and locally sourced foods. Annually, the first Times issue of the new year is the Native's Guide to Pulaski County — a comprehensive guide to communities and services in Little Rock and throughout Arkansas's most populous county.

"Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S. 277 (1983), was a United States Supreme Court case concerned with the scope of the Eighth Amendment protection from cruel and unusual punishment. Mr. Helm, who had written a check from a fictitious account and had reached his seventh nonviolent felony conviction since 1964, received a mandatory sentence, under South Dakota law at that time, to life in prison with no parole. Petitioner Mr. Solem was the warden of the South Dakota State Penitentiary at the time. The Court overturned the sentence on the grounds that it was \""cruel and unusual\"". Justice Powell wrote for the five-member majority, while Chief Justice Burger wrote for the four-member dissent. Justice Powell reasoned that Helm had \""received the penultimate sentence for relatively minor criminal conduct.\"" Chief Justice Burger's concerns reflected his strict constructionist attitude: \""Suppose several states punish severely a crime that the Court views as trivial or petty? I can see no limiting principle in the Court's holding.\"" The language of the opinion, however, refrained from striking down state statutes setting minimum sentencing guidelines for recidivism. The majority opinion only called for exceptions to the statutes protecting the constitutional freedom from cruel and unusual punishment. In addition, the Court sought to use this particular case to clarify the Proportionality Doctrine previously proposed in Enmund v. Florida (1982) by setting precise guidelines for deciding whether a punishment is proportional to the specific crime committed. The Court ruled that all courts must do three things to decide whether a sentence is proportional to a specific crime: 1.  \n*  Compare the nature and gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty, 2.  \n*  Compare the sentences imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction; i.e., whether more serious crimes are subject to the same penalty or to less serious penalties, and 3.  \n*  Compare the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions.",UnitOfWork,LegalCase,SupremeCourtOfTheUnitedStatesCase

He hopes to get help from a Greenpeace ship he sees, but right before his eyes, it sinks.

"Central Única dos Trabalhadores (English: Unified Workers' Central), commonly known by the acronym CUT, is the main national trade union center in Brazil. CUT was formed on August 28, 1983 in São Bernardo do Campo, São Paulo, during the First National Congress of the Working Class. Alongside the Workers' Party (PT) and the Landless Workers' Movement (MST), CUT was one of the key organizations to challenge the military rule of 1964–1985 during its final stages, organizing strikes in automobile factories located in the ABC Region. Nowadays, CUT is the largest and most important trade union federation in Brazil, representing over 7.4 million workers in all productive areas. It is also the largest trade union center in Latin America and the fifth largest in the world. Nevertheless, it continues to face obstacles because of corporatist laws that curb the workers' rights to organize. CUT generally supports a democratic socialist political ideology and is close to PT and its leaders, many of which had been union leaders in the past. CUT was organized to oppose the so-called \""old labour movement\"", associated with the late President Getúlio Vargas and his Brazilian Labour Party (PTB). The main practice of varguismo and its leaders was to try to integrate trade unions and the Ministry of Labor, once the President had based his policy for the area using the Carta del Lavoro of Fascist Italy as a role model. CUT arose as an alternative to this model, claiming to be part of the \""new labour movement\"", independent from the federal government. However, its close ties with PT made CUT a source of criticism after Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, PT's most prominent member, took office as President. In March 2004, some union leaders unsatisfied with the organization's close ties with the Lula administration split from CUT in order to form the Coordenação Nacional de Lutas (Conlutas, English: National Coordination of Struggles). Conlutas represents between 30 and 40 percent of the CUT leadership, and it is closer to the United Socialist Workers' Party (PSTU) and the Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL) – dissidences of PT themselves – than PT. The following year, leaders tied to PSOL and the Brazilian Communist Party (PCB) formed the Instrumento de Luta e Organização da Classe Trabalhadora (Intersindical, English: Instrument of Struggle and Organisation of the Working Class) and, in 2007, leaders linked to the Communist Party of Brazil (PCdoB) formed the Central dos Trabalhadores e Trabalhadoras do Brasil (CTB, English: Central of Male and Female Workers of Brazil).",Agent,Organisation,TradeUnion

"Synthpop (also known as technopop) is a genre of pop music that first became prominent in the late 1970s which features the synthesizer as the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic, art rock, disco, and particularly the \""Krautrock\"" of bands like Kraftwerk. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the new wave movement of the late-1970s to the mid-1980s. Early synthpop pioneers included Japanese group Yellow Magic Orchestra, and British bands Ultravox and The Human League; the latter largely used monophonic synthesizers to produce music with a simple and austere sound. After the breakthrough of Gary Numan in the UK Singles Chart in 1979, large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound in the early 1980s, including late 1970s debutants like Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and Japan, and newcomers such as Depeche Mode and Soft Cell. In Japan, Yellow Magic Orchestra's success opened the way for synthpop bands such as P-Model, Plastics, and Hikashu. The development of inexpensive polyphonic synthesizers, the definition of MIDI and the use of dance beats, led to a more commercial and accessible sound for synthpop. This, its adoption by the style-conscious acts from the New Romantic movement, together with the rise of MTV, led to success for large numbers of British synthpop acts, including Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet, in the United States. In the late 1980s, duos such as Erasure and Pet Shop Boys adopted a sound that was highly successful on the US dance charts, but by the end of the decade synthpop had largely been abandoned. Interest began to be revived in the indietronica and electroclash movements in the late 1990s and, in the first decade of the 21st century, it enjoyed a widespread revival with commercial success for acts including Rihanna, Lady Gaga, La Roux, Owl City, M83 and Chvrches. The genre has received criticism for alleged lack of emotion and musicianship; prominent artists have spoken out against detractors who believed that synthesizers themselves composed and played the songs. Some artists and bands like Depeche Mode, who helped popularise the genre, were criticised for gender bending. Synthpop helped to establish the place of the synthesizer as a major element of pop and rock music, directly influenced subsequent genres including house music and Detroit techno, and has indirectly influenced many other genres and individual recordings.",TopicalConcept,Genre,MusicGenre

"Long Island Head Light is an historic lighthouse on Long Island in Boston, Massachusetts. The current brick tower is the fourth lighthouse on the island. The light was first established in 1819, largely as a result of a study conducted by the Boston Marine Society, which had built the daybeacon on Nixes Mate 14 years earlier. It was a 20-foot (6.1 m) stone tower known as \""Inner Harbor Light\"". It was the second of the four Boston lights—103 years after Boston Light, but ten years before the first daybeacon at the site of Deer Island Light, and before The Graves Light, built in 1905. The stone tower fell into disrepair and was replaced by one of the earliest cast iron lighthouse structures, thirty-four feet tall (pictured below). In 1857, a fourth order Fresnel lens replaced the lamps and reflectors which had been in place. During the next twenty years it sustained damage in a number of storms. In 1881, it was replaced again, by a conical cast iron structure and a new wood keeper's house. Fort Strong was significantly enlarged around the start of the 20th century and it was necessary to move the lighthouse to a location out of the way of the concussion from the guns, so the current brick tower was constructed in 1900-01. Remnants of the fort can be seen to the southeast of the light in the satellite views available by clicking on the coordinates. The Coast Guard discontinued the light in 1982, but reconsidered the decision in 1985, and installed a modern, solar powered system. It received a major refurbishing in the summer of 1998.

"Concordia High School, originally named Concordia College, and subsequently Concordia College High School until 1997, was created with the purpose of preparing young men to attend the Lutheran Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri. Once ordained, they would return to the Canadian Prairies to open up new Lutheran churches. Concordia was established in 1921 with a first class of eighth grade boys. In the 1940s the school became co-ed and became an academic prep school. After World War II the high school continued as a grade nine to twelve program. In 1987 Concordia University College of Alberta was granted degree-granting status. The history and growth of the university is largely owed to the small academic high school that gradually added junior college courses to the high school program until it grew into a full-fledged university college on the same campus, gradually crowding out the original high school program. Many students as a matter of course received their high school diploma and took university courses at Concordia until either graduation or in order to transfer to the University of Alberta. Some of the university faculty as well were previous students or teachers at the high school. In 2000 the high school program was fully detached from the university program. Concordia High School was incorporated as a separate entity with its own board of governors separate from the governance of the university. In 1997 the high school moved to the north edge of campus at 112 Avenue and 73 Street in Edmonton, where it remained for 14 years.

"ARD (full name: Arbeitsgemeinschaft der öffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunkanstalten der Bundesrepublik Deutschland – Consortium of public broadcasters in Germany, details below at name) is a joint organisation of Germany's regional public-service broadcasters. It was founded in 1950 in West Germany to represent the common interests of the new, decentralised, post-war broadcasting services – in particular the introduction of a joint television network. The ARD is the world's largest public broadcaster, with a budget of €6.5 billion and 20,616.5 employees. The budget comes primarily from the licence fees every household, every company and even every public institution like city governments are required to pay. For an ordinary household the fee is currently €17.50 per month. Households living on welfare don't have to pay the fee. The fees are not collected directly by the ARD, but by the Beitragsservice (formerly known as Gebühreneinzugszentrale GEZ), a common organization of the ARD member broadcasters, the second public TV broadcaster ZDF, and Deutschlandradio. ARD maintains and operates a national television network, called Das Erste (\""The First\"") to differentiate it from ZDF, a.k.a. \""das Zweite\"" (\""The Second\""), which started 1963, as a separate public TV-broadcaster. The ARD network began broadcasting on 31 October 1954 under the name of Deutsches Fernsehen (\""German Television\""), becoming Erstes Deutsches Fernsehen (\""First German Television\"") with a corporate redesign in 1984; it adopted its current name (Das Erste) in 1994. ARD's programs are aired over its own terrestrial broadcast network, as well as via cable, satellite and IPTV. ARD also produces three free-to-air digital channels (EinsFestival, EinsPlus and Tagesschau24) and participates in the production of cable/satellite channels Phoenix (current events, news and documentaries), KI.KA (children's programmes), 3sat (cultural/traditional programming) and arte (Franco-German cultural programming). ARD's programming is practiced within Germany's local communities, where its regional members (see also ) (Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR), Hessischer Rundfunk (HR), Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR), Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR), Radio Bremen, Rundfunk Berlin–Brandenburg (RBB), Saarländischer Rundfunk (SR), Südwestrundfunk (SWR) and Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR)) operate 54 regional and local radio stations and seven regional TV networks, some of which split further during certain parts of the day.

"Saint Kessog was an Irish missionary of the mid-sixth century active in the Lennox area and southern Perthshire. Son of the king of Cashel in Ireland, Kessog is said to have worked miracles, even as a child. He left Ireland and became a missionary bishop in Scotland. Using Monks' Island in Loch Lomond as his headquarters, he evangelized the surrounding area until he was martyred, supposedly at Bandry, where a heap of stones was known as St Kessog's Cairn. Kessog was killed in 520 AD. The St McKessog's church in Luss on the banks of Loch Lomond is named after Kessog and the church contains an effigy of the saint. Kessog is claimed to have brought Christianity to the area around Luss in 510 AD and 1500 years of continuous Christian presence in the area was celebrated in 2010. Elsewhere in Scotland, the medieval parish churches of Auchterarder and Comrie, both in Perthshire, were dedicated to Kessog, and may have been founded by him or one of his followers. The Kessock area of Inverness is named after the saint, as is the Kessog oil field in the North Sea.

"Henry Joseph Gardner (June 14, 1819 – July 21, 1892) was the 23rd Governor of Massachusetts, serving from 1855 to 1858. Gardner, a Know Nothing, was elected governor as part of the sweeping victory of Know Nothing candidates in the Massachusetts elections of 1854. Born in Dorchester, Gardner was a dry goods merchant from Boston active in the local Whig Party in the early 1850s. With the sudden and secretive rise of the nativist Know Nothings in 1854, Gardner opportunistically repudiated previously-held positions, and joined the movement, winning a landslide victory over Whig Emory Washburn. During his three terms in office the Know Nothing legislatures enacted legislation on a wide-ranging reform agenda, and made several significant changes to the state constitution, including important electoral reforms such as the replacement of majority voting with plurality voting. The Know Nothing movement began to disintegrate not long after its 1854 victory, dividing over slavery. Gardner won reelection in 1856 only with Republican support, given in exchange for Know Nothing support for the Republican presidential candidate, John Frémont. Republican Nathaniel Prentice Banks easily defeated Gardner in 1857, and the Know Nothing movement effectively dissolved. By 1860 Gardner had left politics and returned to his business interests; he died in relative obscurity.",Agent,Politician,Governor

"Lake Boonderoo is an ephemeral freshwater lake located in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia. It is situated approximately 200 kilometres (124 mi) east of Kambalda on the Nullarbor Plain. The lake covers an area of roughly 2,500 hectares (6,178 acres) when full. It is fed by Ponton Creek on its north western side. The lake lies mostly within the boundaries of Boonderoo and Kanandah Stations which were established in the 1960s and have been running cattle since 1973. The lake has filled in 1975 following heavy rain events further north near Leonora after a cyclone. The rains filled both Lake Braeside and Lake Rebecca to overflow down Ponton Creek to fill Boonderoo and expand out to an area of between 50 square kilometres (19 sq mi) to 80 square kilometres (31 sq mi). The next time the lake filled was in 1995 following Cyclone Bobby. Lake Boonderoo is an important wetland for birds and invertebrates as it dries out and becomes increasingly saline.

"Sphinx franckii (Franck's sphinx moth) is a moth in the family Sphingidae. It is known from lowland deciduous woodland in the eastern United States but also suburban areas where Lilacs (Syringa species) are planted, ranging from New York to northern Florida east to Missouri and Louisiana. The wingspan is 100–128 mm. There is one generation in the north with adults on wing from late June to early July. In the south, there may be a partial second generation with adults on wing from August to September. Adults most frequently nectar from phlox (Phlox paniculata and cultivars). However, males will occasionally gather over moist charcoal to obtain nutrients from the charred wood prior to copulation. Adults fly at dusk and in the early morning hours. The larvae feed on several plants in the olive family. The only native hosts of this moth are ash (Fraxinus) and fringe tree (Chionanthus virginicus). However, larvae seem to have a liking for ornamental lilac (Syringa), and occasionally will feed on privet (Ligustrum). Larvae are commonly parasitized by native braconid wasps. The introduced tachinid fly poses additional threat to the beautiful caterpillars of this species. Larvae pupate in subterranean chambers a few inches beneath the surface of the ground. The pupa is a shiny, chestnut-brown color.",Species,Animal,Insect

The magazine, and its associated mail-order kit business, operated for its entirety out of Mitchell's home. Competing magazines at the time were Electronics Australia, Electronics Today International, and Australian Electronics Monthly. The general magazine lasted 15 official issues, but there were many one-off publications produced in addition to the issue-based magazine. Some of these included the FM Bugs series of books, The Electronics Notebook series, and model railway projects. The first issue was in 1981, with the last issue being #15 in May 1989. Mitchell has since released all material, books, and issues of the magazine as public domain on his websites – \""Not Copyright 2003 Colin Mitchell - you can copy anything - in fact you should copy all the projects and data sheets.\"" There was no regular publishing schedule; an issue would come out when it was completed.

Talking Electronics also sold electronics kits to go along with its published construction projects. This business proved very popular, with hundreds of thousands of kits being sold. Payment for the kits could be made using postage stamps, to make it easier for young hobbyists to afford and pay for the kits.

The ruling National Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party were removed from power by a union of the party's Military Committee and the Regional Command, under the leadership of Salah Jadid. The coup was precipitated by a heightening in the power struggle between the party's old guard, represented by Michel Aflaq, Salah al-Din al-Bitar, and Munif al-Razzaz, and the younger factions adhering to a Neo-Ba'athist position. On 21 February, supporters of the old guard in the army ordered the transfer of their rivals. Two days later, the Military Committee, backing the younger factions, launched a coup that involved violent fighting in Aleppo, Damascus, Deir ez-Zor, and Latakia. As a result of the coup, the party's historical founders fled the country and spent the rest of their lives in exile. Jadid's government was the most radical administration in Syria's history. The coup created a permanent schism between the Syrian and Iraqi regional branches of the Ba'ath Party and their respective National Commands, with many senior Syrian Ba'athists defecting to Iraq. As a legacy of the coup, during Jadid's rule, Syria initiated a propaganda campaign against the Iraqi Ba'athists.

Monastic life had declined to a low ebb in England in the ninth century, partly due to the ravages caused by Viking attacks, and partly because of a preference for secular clergy, who were cheaper and were thought to better serve the spiritual needs of the laity. Kings from Alfred the Great onwards took an interest in the Benedictine rule, but it was only in the middle of the tenth century that kings became ready to commit substantial funds to its support. Æthelwold became the leading propagandist for the monastic reform movement, although he made enemies by his ruthless methods, and he was more extreme in his opposition to secular clergy than his fellow reformers, Saint Dunstan and Oswald of Worcester. He is nevertheless recognised as a key figure in the reform movement, who also made a major contribution to the revival of learning and the arts.

"The United States presidential election of 1896 was the 28th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 3, 1896. It was the climax of an intensely heated contest in which Republican candidate William McKinley (a former Governor of Ohio) defeated Democrat William Jennings Bryan (a former Representative from Nebraska) in one of the most dramatic and complex races in American history. The 1896 campaign is often considered to be a realigning election that ended the old Third Party System and began the Fourth Party System. McKinley forged a conservative coalition in which businessmen, professionals, skilled factory workers, and prosperous farmers were heavily represented. He was strongest in cities and in the Northeast, Upper Midwest, and Pacific Coast. Bryan was the nominee of the Democrats, the Populist Party, and the Silver Republicans. He presented his campaign as a crusade of the working man against the rich, who impoverished America by limiting the money supply, which was based on gold. Silver, he said, was in ample supply and if coined into money would restore prosperity while undermining the illicit power of the money trust. Bryan was strongest in the South, rural Midwest, and Rocky Mountain states. Bryan's moralistic rhetoric and crusade for inflation (to be generated by a money supply based on silver as well as gold) alienated conservatives. Turnout was very high, passing 90% of the eligible voters in many places. Since the Panic of 1893, the nation had been mired in a deep economic depression, marked by low prices, low profits, high unemployment, and violent strikes. Economic issues, especially tariff policy and the question of whether the gold standard should be preserved for the money supply, were central issues. Republican campaign manager Mark Hanna pioneered many modern campaign techniques, facilitated by a $3.5 million budget. He outspent Bryan by a factor of five. The Democratic Party's repudiation of its economically conservative Bourbon faction, represented by incumbent President Grover Cleveland, largely gave Bryan and his supporters control of the Democratic Party until the 1920s, and set the stage for Republican domination of the Fourth Party System and control of the White House for 28 of the next 36 years, interrupted only by the two terms of Democrat Woodrow Wilson.",Event,SocietalEvent,Election

"Sergeant Percivale St-Helier LeSueur (November 21, 1881 – January 27, 1962) was a Canadian senior and professional ice hockey goaltender. He was a member of the Smiths Falls Seniors for three years, with whom his performance in a 1906 Stanley Cup challenge series attracted the attention of his opponents, the Ottawa Silver Seven. Although his team lost the series, LeSueur excelled in goal, keeping the games close. Nine days after the defeat, he joined the Silver Seven and played in a challenge match against the Montreal Wanderers. He remained with Ottawa through the 1913–14 season where he served as team captain for three seasons, and assumed coaching duties in his final season with the team. LeSueur was traded to the Toronto Shamrocks for the 1914–15 season. After playing the following season for the Toronto Blueshirts, he enlisted in the army and fought for Canada during the First World War. He returned to hockey following the conclusion of the war, serving in various roles including referee, coach, manager, arena manager, and hockey journalist. He coached ten games in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Hamilton Tigers. As a journalist, he was the first reporter to include shots on goal statistics in game summaries. During his playing career, LeSueur improved upon existing ice hockey equipment: he invented the gauntlet-style goaltender glove which protected the forearms, and created and patented the LeSueur net which was designed to catch high-rising shots.

"Mānana Island is an uninhabited islet located 0.75 mi (1.21 km) off Kaupō Beach, near Makapuʻu at the eastern end of the Island of Oʻahu in the Hawaiian Islands. In the Hawaiian language, mānana means \""buoyant\"". The islet is commonly referred to as Rabbit Island, because its shape as seen from the nearby Oʻahu shore looks something like a rabbit's head and because it was once inhabited by introduced rabbits. The rabbit colony was established by John Adams Cummins in the 1880s when he ran the nearby Waimānalo plantation.The rabbits were eradicated about a hundred years later because they were destroying the native ecosystem, an important seabird breeding area. Mānana is a tuff cone with two vents or craters. The highest point on the islet rises to 361 ft (110 m). The island is 2,319 ft (707 m) long and 2,147 ft (654 m) wide and has an area of about 63 acres (25 ha). Mānana’s only sand beach is a small storm beach on the west to south-west (leeward) side of the islet. This sand deposit, located above the reach of the normal waves, is about 30 ft (9.1 m) wide and curves around to the western side of the island. Manana was formed by the Honolulu Volcanic Series. These series of eruptions are responsible for creating other tuff cones such as Punchbowl Crater. Mānana is a State Seabird Sanctuary—home to over 10,000 wedge-tailed shearwaters, 80,000 sooty terns, 20,000 brown noddys, 5–10 Bulwer's petrels, and 10–15 red-tailed tropicbirds, and numerous Hawaiian monk seals.

"The Burma Socialist Party (Burmese: ဗမာပြည် ဆိုရှယ်လစ်ပါတီ), initially known as the People's Freedom (Socialist) Party was a political party in Burma. BSP was the dominant party in Burmese politics after 1948. It was the dominant political force inside the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League. The party was founded in September 1945. It was a successor to the wartime People's Revolutionary Party. The military elite actively supported the build-up of the party. The party was founded in order to counter the influence of the Communist Party of Burma within the AFPFL. Before the foundation of the PF(S)P, the communists had openly emerged as a bloc inside AFPFL. The PF(S)P was founded by a nucleus consisting of Ba Swe, Kyaw Nyein and five others. As Thakin Mya arrived in Rangoon in 1945, he became the chairman of the party. Ba Swe served as general secretary and Kyaw Nyein as joint secretary. Seeking to counter the influence of the communist All Burma Trade Union Congress, the socialists launched the Trade Union Congress (Burma) in November 1945. In 1947 Thakin Mya was murdered alongside Aung San. Ko Ko Gyi became the new party chairman in July 1947. However in the summer of 1948, he was asked to resign from his positions in the party and the government. In reaction, Ko Ko Gyi left the party and joined the underground insurgency. After Ko Ko Gyi's defection, the post of chairman was abolished in the party. From that period onwards, the party was led by Ba Swe and Kyaw Nyein. In 1948 the name of the party was changed to 'Burma Socialist Party'. In 1949 it became the 'Union of Socialist Party'. From 1950 onwards it was again called the 'Burma Socialist Party'. The party published The Socialist Front Weekly Journal. The party initially relied on support from affiliated mass organisations such as the Workers' Asiayone, Peasants' Asiayone, Women's Asiayone, etc.. However, after 1950 the party developed into more of a cadre party. The strong links to the Trade Union Congress (Burma) was retained though. In December 1950 the party suffered a severe split, as the leftwing tendency in the party broke away and formed the Burma Workers and Peasants Party. The membership of the Burma Socialist Party is estimated to have dropped from around 2,000 to just 200 as a consequence of the split. By 1956, the party membership was estimated at 6,000.

"The slaty flowerpiercer, Diglossa plumbea, is a passerine bird which is endemic to the highlands of Costa Rica and western Panama. This is a common bird in mountain forest canopy and edges, and especially in sunlit clearings and areas with flowering shrubs, which can include gardens. The lower altitudinal limit of its breeding range increases from 1200 m in the north of Costa Rica to 1900 m in the southern mountains. It is found well above the timberline in páramo habitat. The large cup nest, built by the female, is made of coarse plant material and lined with fine fibres. It is placed 0.4 to 4 m up in a dense shrub, grass tussock or pine. The clutch is two brown-speckled pale blue eggs, which are incubated by the female alone for 12–14 days to hatching. The slaty flowerpiercer has an upturned bill with a hooked upper mandible and pointed lower mandible. It is 10 cm long and weighs 9 g. The adult male is blue-grey with a lead-grey throat and breast. The tail and wings are blackish with grey feather edges. The female is olive-brown above with a paler throat and breast shading to buff on the belly.

"Founded in 1870 by Jaime Torres, Bodegas Torres (Miguel Torres SA) is a historical wine growing company located in Pacs, some 4 km from Vilafranca del Penedès, where the company has its head office. Torres is the family winery with the most extensive vineyards in the Denomination of Origin (DO) of Penedès and the largest winery in Spain. They also run the Miguel Torres Chile winery in the Chilean Central Valley, and in the United States (California) where in 1986 Marimar Torres founded Marimar Estate. In Spain outside of the Torres family's native Penedès region, they own vineyards in DO Conca de Barberà, DO Toro, DO Jumilla, DO Ribera del Duero, DOQ Priorat and most recently in DOC Rioja - in the last three areas with new wineries or wineries under construction. Likewise, Torres is also Spain's largest producer of DO wines under its own label, exporting to more than 140 countries. Under the Torres brand name they trade wine and brandy under on a range of different labels. Some of these are Viña Sol, Sangre de Toro, De Casta, Coronas, Atrium and Viña Esmeralda, with their best known brandies being Torres 5 and Torres 10. Many Torres wines are produced from international rather than traditional Spanish grape varieties and are varietally labelled. The company exports wines to over 140 countries. Torres made two significant contributions to the development of enology in Spain: firstly, the use of fermentation at controlled temperatures, and secondly, the maturing of the wine in small oak barrels during a scrupulously defined time, as has been a habitual practice in Bordeaux. Torres is managed by the fourth generation of the Torres family; Miguel A. Torres is the company’s current President and Managing Director.

"The 1986 Chicago Bears season was their 67th regular season and 17th post-season completed in the National Football League. The Bears entered the season looking to repeat as Super Bowl champions, as they had won in 1985. Chicago managed to finish 14–2, one game off of their 1985 record of 15–1, and tied the New York Giants for the league's best record. After winning the championship in 1985, the team seemed like a dynasty in the making. However, quarterback Jim McMahon showed up to training camp 25 pounds overweight – the product of the post-Super Bowl partying he'd partaken in. Nonetheless, he was once again named as the starter. Injuries, however, derailed his season. McMahon played in only six of the team's first 12 games. In week 12, McMahon was on the receiving end of one of the most vicious hits in NFL history. In a game against the Green Bay Packers, McMahon was blindsided by Packers defensive lineman Charles Martin. Martin had gone into the game with a hit list of Bears players. McMahon was his first victim. After McMahon threw an interception, Martin hoisted the quarterback into the air and slammed him into the ground, a few seconds after the play had ended. McMahon writhed on the ground in pain, having suffered a separated shoulder. He was out for the remainder of the year. Still, the Bears won that game, and went undefeated for the rest of the regular season as well. McMahon's loss may have been a blessing in disguise, as by any standard, he was having a horrible season. Aided by a strong offensive line, the Bears were once again led on offense by Walter Payton. Payton remained his usual stellar self, posting his 10th and final 1000-yard season. With McMahon's poor play, as well as the equally poor play of backups Mike Tomczak, Steve Fuller and Doug Flutie, Payton was the sole spark on offense, which ranked 13th in the NFL. As had been the case the year before, the Bears were once again led by their explosive defense. Any shortcomings on the offensive side of the ball were more than made up for on the defensive side. They once again were ranked #1 in the NFL. The Bears' defense became the third defense in the history of the NFL to lead the league in fewest points allowed and fewest total yards allowed for two consecutive seasons. The Bears' 187 points allowed is the fewest surrendered by any team in the 1980s (other than the strike-shortened 1982 season) – even fewer than the 198 points the Bears allowed in their historic 1985 season. However, the Bears were not able to recapture their magic from the season before and were bounced from the playoffs in their first game by the Washington Redskins.",SportsSeason,FootballLeagueSeason,NationalFootballLeagueSeason

"The Fabrosauridae is an obsolete group of basal ornithischian dinosaurs from the Early to Middle Jurassic, originally proposed by Galton (1972). Recent studies indicate the Fabrosaurs are not a natural grouping of dinosaurs, and instead consist of unrelated genera. The proposed \""Fabrosaurs\"" descended from a Lesothosaurus-like animal. Proposed fabrosaurids were 1–2 meters long, and were lightly built and bipedal. Their skulls were triangular and had very large eye sockets. They were herbivorous and would have used agility to escape predators. Fabrosaurids are known from southern Africa in the Upper Triassic and Lower Jurassic, as well as in China from the Middle and Upper Jurassic periods. Fabrosaurids bear a semblance to many other members of Ornithischia, and have attracted much interest in phylogenetic studies. However, most genera that were previously referred to as Fabrosauridae are only known from fragmented and partial remains, with most based on no more than isolated teeth, and their place in Fabrosauridae is questionable. Galton in 1972 originally proposed the creation of Fabrosauridae based on the finding of cheek teeth. The successive discovery (1990) of a Middle Jurassic primitive ornithischian, Agilisaurus louderbacki, found in the Xiashaximiao Formation of Zigong, Sichuan Basin, China, has led to paleontologists learning more about the phylogeny of fabrosaurids. Fabrosaurids have many characters that are unique to their physiology, particularly unique tooth morphology and structure, and short forelimb lengths compared to hindlimbs. Unlike many other primitive Ornithischians, such as heterodontosaurids and hypsilophodontids, the teeth of fabrosaurids are very thinly and uniformly enameled. Compared to Agilisaurus, Fabrosaurus is much more primitive in that it has six premaxillary teeth, and a stout prepubis. Agilisaurus differs from Fabrosaurus in that it appears to be larger and more well developed in structure. The Upper Jurassic ornithischian dinosaur, Gongubusaurus, from China, is thought to be more closely related to fabrosaurids than hypsilophodontids. The type species, G. shiyii, is from the Shangshaximiao Formation in the Rongxian County in Sichuan Basin, has been classified from only a few scattered teeth.",Species,Animal,Reptile

"The Hamburg S-Bahn is rapid mass transit railway network in the Hamburg Metropolitan Region. Together, the S-Bahn, the Hamburg U-Bahn, the AKN railway and the regional railway form the backbone of railway public transport in the city and the surrounding area. The network has operated since 1907 as an electric rapid transit system, under the direction of the state railway, and is member of Hamburger Verkehrsverbund (HVV), Hamburg's transport association. There are six lines, serving 68 stations, on 147 kilometres (91 mi) of route. On an average working day the S-Bahn transports about 590,000 passengers; in 2010 about 221 million people used the S-Bahn. The S-Bahn is the only railway in Germany that uses both direct current (1,200 Volts) supplied by a third rail and alternating current (15 kV / 16.7 Hz) supplied by overhead lines. Most of the tracks are separated from other rail services. The S-Bahn is operated by S-Bahn Hamburg GmbH, a subsidiary of DB Regio. Similarly to Berlin but unlike Hanover, the S-Bahn is an important part of public transport within the city due to its dense schedule and good coverage of the metropolitan region. Unlike both Berlin and Hanover, the S-Bahn is of little importance for regional traffic since the network lies mostly within the city, though in 2007 the southwestern S3 line was extended about 32 km (20 miles) into the state of Lower Saxony (the Neugraben - Stade portion, which included seven new stations).",Agent,Organisation,PublicTransitSystem

"Mocho-Choshuenco (Pronounced: /ˈmɒtʃoʊ tʃɒsˈwɛnkoʊ/ MO-choh CHOS-wen-KOH) is a glacier covered compound stratovolcano in the Andes of Los Ríos Region, Chile. It is made of the twin volcanoes Choshuenco in the northwest and the Mocho in the southeast. The highest parts of the volcano are part of the Mocho-Choshuenco National Reserve while the eastern slopes are partly inside the Huilo-Huilo Natural Reserve. Choshuenco, located on the northwest rim of the 4 km wide caldera, is of late glacial age. It has a heavily eroded crater and is currently dormant. Mocho is an andesitic-dacitic volcano placed above the caldera. Some parasitic craters and cinder cones are located on the southwest and northeast flanks of the stratovolcano. Mocho has its earliest certainly recorded eruption in 1759, older eruptions reported are uncertain due to the usage of different names and inexact maps. The northern foothills of Mocho-Choshuenco are surrounded by an arc of rivers and lakes formed by Fui, Enco and Llanquihue River, and Pirihueico, Panguipulli and Riñihue Lakes. The Fui River has high degree of underground infiltration, such that in some years the Huilo-Huilo Falls may dry out completely.

"Nothomyrmecia, also known as the dinosaur ant or dawn ant, is a rare genus of ants consisting of a single species, Nothomyrmecia macrops. It lives in South Australia, nesting in old-growth mallee woodland and Eucalyptus woodland. The full distribution of Nothomyrmecia has never been assessed, and it is unknown how widespread it really is; its potential range may be wider if it does favour old-growth mallee woodland. Possible threats to its survival include habitat destruction and climate change. Nothomyrmecia is most active when it is cold because workers encounter fewer competitors and predators such as Camponotus and Iridomyrmex, and it also increases hunting success. Thus, the increase of temperature may prevent them from foraging and very few areas would be suitable for the ant to live in. As a result, the IUCN lists the ant as Critically Endangered. A medium-sized ant, Nothomyrmecia measures 9.7–11 mm (0.38–0.43 in). Workers are monomorphic, showing little morphological differentiation among one another. Mature colonies are very small, with only 50 to 100 individuals in each nest. Workers are strictly nocturnal (active mainly at night) and are solitary foragers, collecting arthropod prey and sweet substances such as honeydew from scale insects and other Hemiptera. They rely on their vision to navigate and there is no evidence to suggest that the species use chemicals to communicate when foraging, but they do use chemical alarm signals. A queen ant will mate with one or more males and, during colony foundation, she will hunt for food until the brood have fully developed. Queens are univoltine (i.e. they produce just one generation of ants each year). Two queens may establish a colony together, but only one will remain once the first generation of workers has been reared. Nothomyrmecia was first described by Australian entomologist John S. Clark in 1934 from two specimens of worker ants. These were reportedly collected in 1931 near the Russell Range, inland from Israelite Bay in Western Australia. After its initial discovery, the ant was not seen again for four decades until a group of entomologists rediscovered it in 1977, 1,300 km (810 mi) away from the original reported site. Dubbed as the 'Holy Grail' of myrmecology, the ant was subject to great scientific interest after its rediscovery, attracting scientists from around the world. In Poochera (the rediscovery site), pictures of the ant are stenciled on the streets, and it is perhaps the only town in the world that thrives off ant-based tourism. Some entomologists have suggested a relationship to the Baltic Eocene fossil ant genus Prionomyrmex based on morphological similarities, but this interpretation is not widely accepted by the entomological community. Owing to its body structure, Nothomyrmecia is regarded to be the most primitive ant alive and a 'living fossil', stimulating studies on its morphology, behaviour, ecology, and chromosomes.",Species,Animal,Insect

"The Mintaka Pass or Mingteke Pass (simplified Chinese: 明铁盖达坂; traditional Chinese: 明鐵蓋達坂; pinyin: Míngtiěgě Dábǎn) is a mountain pass in the Karakorum Mountains, between Pakistan and Xinjiang in China. In ancient times, the Mintaka Pass and the nearby Kilik Pass (4,827 m or 15,837 ft high; 37°05′N 74°41′E﻿ / ﻿37.083°N 74.683°E), 30 km (19 mi) to the west, were the two main access points into the Upper Hunza Valley from the north. The Hunza Valley is a mountainous valley near Gilgit in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. These were the shortest and quickest ways into northern India from the Tarim Basin and were usually open all year, but extremely dangerous and only suited for travellers on foot. From Tashkurgan one travelled just over 70 km (43 mi) south to the junction of the Minteke River. Heading some 80 km (50 mi) west up this valley one reached the Mintaka Pass, (and 30 km further, the alternative Kilik Pass), which both led into upper Hunza, from where one could travel over the infamous rafiqs or \""hanging passages\"" to Gilgit and, from there, on to either to Kashmir, or the Gandharan plains. Laden animals could be taken over the Mintaka and Kilik passes into upper Hunza (both open all year), but then loads would have to be carried by coolie (porters) to Gilgit (an expensive and dangerous operation). From there, cargoes could be reloaded onto pack animals again and taken either east to Kashmir and then on to Taxila (a long route), or west to Chitral which provided relatively easy access to either Jalalabad, or Peshawar via Swat. The Mintaka Pass was the main one used in ancient times until the fairly recent advance of glacier ice. After the glaciation of the Mintaka Pass, the Kilik Pass was favoured by caravans coming from China and Afghanistan as it is wider, free of glaciers and provided enough pasture for caravan animals.

"Giacinto Calandrucci (Palermo 20 April 1646 – 22 February 1707, Palermo) was an Italian painter of the Baroque period. Originally from Palermo, he moved to Rome with his fellow Palermitan painter and engraver Pietro del Pò. Like many painters in Rome in his day, then entered the large and prolific studio of Carlo Maratta. He afterwords worked under Giuseppe Passeri. In the 1680s Calandrucci completed decorative frescoes of the Four Seasons in the Palazzo Lante; mythological frescoes in the gallery of the Palazzo Muti–Papazzurri; the decoration of the gallery of the Palazzo Strozzi–Besso; and a ceiling fresco, and the Sacrifice of Ceres in the papal Villa Falconieri at Frascati. He also painted idyllic pastoral scenes, among them two pictures at Burghley House, Stamford, England. He also painted in Rome two works for the main altar and the Cimini Chapel in the church of Sant'Antonio dei Portoghesi, a Virgin and Child with St Anne and Saints in frescoes and canvases in San Bonaventura (before 1686), a Holy Family with St Anne and a St Anthony of Padua, both in San Paolo alla Regola (c. 1700), and frescoes in Santa Maria dell’Orto (c. 1700–05). In 1705 he returned to Palermo, where he began the decoration of the oratory of San Lorenzo. He also painted for the church of San Salvatore, representing The Virgin with St. Basil and other Saints.

"Harry Chidgey (25 July 1879 – 16 November 1941) was a first-class cricketer who played for Somerset as a wicketkeeper between 1900 and 1921, and a Test match umpire. He was born and died at Flax Bourton, Somerset. Chidgey was the elder son of the innkeeper at the Angel Inn in Flax Bourton. He played as a professional cricketer for Somerset as a lower-order batsman and wicketkeeper and made his debut in the game against Gloucestershire in 1900. But with the amateurs Archie Wickham, Henry Martyn and Arthur Newton often available, Chidgey had just two further games in the 1902 season, and then did not reappear for six seasons. In the 1901 census, when he is living with his parents, he is listed as a \""merchant's clerk\"". After Somerset's disastrous 1907 season, Wickham retired and Newton scaled down his availability, so that from 1908 Chidgey became Somerset's regular wicketkeeper for the seasons up to, and just beyond, the First World War, though Newton made sporadic reappearances in several matches most seasons, nearly always home games for Somerset, and always displacing Chidgey: an indication of the pecking order between amateurs and professionals in Edwardian cricket is that of Chidgey's 99 first-class games, only 32 were home matches, and 18 of those were at Bath, the furthest outpost of Somerset cricket. In 1913, for example, he played 11 first-class games, one of them for MCC and only one was in Somerset. But by the 1911 census, at which time he had been married and widowed, he was able to call himself a \""professional cricketer\"" on the census form. Chidgey batted normally at No 11 throughout his first-class career, but his highest score came in the 1909 season when he was sent in as nightwatchman at No 3 against Yorkshire at Bath and made 45, his partnership with the dour Len Braund enabling Somerset to draw the match. He returned to Somerset for the 1919 season after the First World War, but the county then cut the number of professionals in its team to two in the 1920 season, and he did not play at all that year; he returned, however, for some games in 1921 before leaving finally. In 1925 and 1926, he was on the first-class umpires' list, and he was picked, alongside Sailor Young, for the fourth Test between England and Australia on the 1926 tour; the game, at Manchester, was ruined by rain with less than two full innings completed. He was picked as an umpire for first-class matches again in the 1927 season, but did not appear in any games. In his obituary in the 1942 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Chidgey was described as \""rather small, quick and neat\""; he had played for his local club at Flax Bourton from the age of 14 and was also involved in village affairs as a member of what Wisden terms \""Long Ashton Urban District Council\"" (in fact, a rural district council).",Agent,Athlete,Cricketer
"Alcock's Arabian (foaled c.1707, died c.1733), also known as Pelham Grey Arabian and possibly Bloody Buttocks and Ancaster Turk among others, is the ancestor of all grey-coloured Thoroughbred horses, as well as grey sport and riding horses descended from Thoroughbred lines.

"Europa /jʊˈroʊpə/ (Jupiter II), is the sixth-closest moon of Jupiter, and the smallest of its four Galilean satellites, and the sixth-largest moon in the Solar System. Europa was discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and was named after Zeus' (the Greek equivalent of the Roman god Jupiter) lover Europa, mother of King Minos of Crete. In addition to Earth-bound telescope observations, Europa has been examined by a succession of space probe flybys, the first occurring in the early 1970s. Slightly smaller than the Moon, Europa is primarily made of silicate rock and has a water-ice crust and probably an iron–nickel core. It has a tenuous atmosphere composed primarily of oxygen. Its surface is striated by cracks and streaks, whereas craters are relatively rare. It has the smoothest surface of any known solid object in the Solar System. The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface have led to the hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably serve as an abode for extraterrestrial life. The predominant model suggests that heat from tidal flexing causes the ocean to remain liquid and drives ice movement similar to plate tectonics, absorbing chemicals from the surface into the ocean below. Also, sea salt from a subsurface ocean may be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the seafloor. This may be important in determining if Europa could be habitable. In addition, the Hubble Space Telescope detected water vapor plumes similar to those observed on Saturn's moon Enceladus, which are thought to be caused by erupting cryogeysers. The Galileo mission, launched in 1989, provides the bulk of current data on Europa. No spacecraft has yet landed on Europa, but its intriguing characteristics have led to several ambitious exploration proposals. The European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE) is a mission to Ganymede that is due to launch in 2022, but it will conduct two flybys of Europa. NASA's planned Europa Multiple-Flyby Mission will be launched in the mid-2020s.",Place,CelestialBody,Planet
"The Leicester Royal Infirmary (LRI) is a large National Health Service hospital in Leicester, England. It is located to the south-west of the city centre. It has Leicester's accident and emergency department, and is part of the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust. The hospital was originally founded in 1771 by Reverend William Watts, hosting 40 beds. Patients were forced to pay a deposit when they went in; if they went home, the money was repaid back, if they died their deposit would be spent on burying them. When first opened, there was no running water, but there was the nearby brewery, which was used to treat the patients. By 1808, the hospital had expanded by 20 beds, holding now 60. In 1808, the first matron was employed at £10 a year, this increased over the years, and many matrons and nurses helped patients recover, by looking after them, and making beds. There are many separate sections in the hospital, named after royal residences in Great Britain and Northern Ireland - Windsor, Balmoral, Osborne, Sandringham and Victoria. The Windsor building was opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in 1993.

"John George Schmitz (August 12, 1930 – January 10, 2001) was a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives and California State Senate from Orange County, California. He was also a member of the John Birch Society. In 1972 he was the American Independent Party candidate for President of the United States, later known as the American Party. Schmitz was notable for his extreme right-wing sympathies. By one measure, he was found to be the third most conservative member of Congress between 1937 and 2002, and the ultra-conservative John Birch Society, of which Schmitz was a longtime leader, later expelled him for extremist rhetoric. On October 25, 1971 Schmitz composed an introduction to the highly controversial book None Dare Call it Conspiracy written by Gary Allen with Larry Abraham. In 1982, after it was revealed—and Schmitz admitted—that he had engaged in an extra-marital affair and fathered two children with one of his former college students, Schmitz's career as a politician effectively ended, as did his wife Mary's as a conservative political commentator. Two of Schmitz's children, sons John and Joseph, have held prominent posts in Republican presidential administrations. Son Joseph Schmitz has also worked for the international security firm Blackwater USA.

"Belmond Maroma Resort and Spa is a hotel on Mexico’s Riviera Maya, 30 miles south of Cancún. It was built by Mexico City architect Jose Luis Moreno  a specialist in designing restaurants and small hotels, and opened in 1995. Moreno had first visited the area in 1976, when Cancún had few hotels and an airport terminal with a thatched roof. He first built a home for himself and then another which he planned to sell. In 1988 a hurricane destroyed the second house and he decided to rebuild it as a hotel. The hotel is built from local materials, including palm, bamboo and stone quarried in Mérida (the Yucatán’s old Hispanic capital). Two- or three-storey buildings are dotted on the 25-acre beachfront portion of the 500-acre property, linked by stone walkways through the jungle. The resort was constructed without formal blueprints as Moreno always drew his free-flowing designs in the sand. Once he had his concept, a family of local masons, with whom he had worked on other projects, came to implement his designs. In 2002 the resort was acquired by Orient-Express Hotels, which in 2014 changed its name to Belmond Ltd. At that time the hotel was renamed Belmond Maroma Resort & Spa  The company still uses the same family of Maya masons that have been working at the resort for over four decades and have added new oceanfront spa villas, expanded the restaurant and bar, added two new pools and built Kinan Spa.",Place,Building,Hotel

"Luna 1, also known as Mechta (Russian: Мечта, lit.: Dream), E-1 No.4 and First Lunar Rover , was the first spacecraft to reach the vicinity of the Earth's Moon, and the first spacecraft to be placed in heliocentric orbit. Intended as an impactor, Luna 1 was launched as part of the Luna programme in 1959, however due to an incorrectly timed upper stage burn during its launch, it missed the Moon; in the process becoming the first spacecraft to leave geocentric orbit. While traveling through the outer Van Allen radiation belt, the spacecraft's scintillator made observations indicating that a small number of high energy particles exist in the outer belt. The measurements obtained during this mission provided new data on the Earth's radiation belt and outer space. The Moon was found to have no detectable magnetic field. The first ever direct observations and measurements of the solar wind, a strong flow of ionized plasma emanating from the Sun and streaming through interplanetary space, were performed. That ionized plasma concentration was measured to be some 700 particles per cm3 at altitudes 20–25 thousand km and 300 to 400 particles per cm3 at altitudes 100–150,000 km. The spacecraft also marked the first instance of radio communication at the half-million-kilometer distance. A malfunction in the ground-based control system caused an error in the rocket's burntime, and the spacecraft missed the target and flew by the Moon at a distance of 5,900 km at the closest point.

Born in Mossel Bay and educated in Cape Town and then Charterhouse School, England, Charlie Vintcent, was without doubt the most versatile South African sportsman of his time. He excelled in many sport he played representing both Western Province and Transvaal at rugby, obtaining his national colours for soccer, a sport he did much to promote on the Reef and as an athlete he was the Transvaal sprint champion in the events from the 100 yards to 440 yards for three years from 1889 to 1891, besides being competitive at both the long and high jump events. Charlie was a left-handed all-rounder who played in both tests in the first home series against England as well as the only test of the 1891/92 series against the second English touring side. He owed his original selection to his fine performance for Kimberley in the fifth match of the tour falling 13 runs short of a century and taking nine wickets in the match for one hundred and five runs off eighty nine overs. He was unable to carry this form into the Internationals and his Test record is not a true reflection of his ability. Nevertheless, he enjoyed a long career in provincial cricket which lasted some twenty seasons playing first an important role for Transvaal in the early Currie Cup fixtures, and then when he returned to the Southern Cape, he captained them in their only appearance at provincial level, by which stage he was close to forty years of age. Charlie Vintcent lived a long and active life, dying in 1943 at the age of seventy seven.",Agent,Athlete,Cricketer

"Messier 32 (also known as NGC 221) is a dwarf elliptical galaxy about 2.65 million light-years away in the constellation Andromeda. M32 is a satellite galaxy of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and was discovered by Le Gentil in 1749. M32 measures 6.5 ± 0.2 thousand light-years in diameter at the widest point. Like most elliptical galaxies, M32 contains mostly older faint red and yellow stars with practically no dust or gas and consequently no current star formation. It does, however, show hints of star formation in the relatively recent past. The structure and stellar content of M32 is difficult to explain by traditional galaxy formation models. Some simulations suggest a scenario in which the strong tidal field of M31 can transform a spiral galaxy into a compact elliptical. As a small spiral galaxy falls into the central parts of M31, most of the outer layers of the smaller spiral are stripped away. The central bulge of the galaxy is much less affected and retains its morphology. Tidal effects trigger a massive star burst in the core, resulting in the high density of M32 observed today. There is also evidence that M32 has an outer disk.",Place,CelestialBody,Galaxy

"The European bitterling (Rhodeus amarus) is a temperate freshwater fish belonging to the Acheilognathinae subfamily of the Cyprinidae family. It originates in Europe, ranging from the Rhone River basin in France to the Neva River in Russia. It was originally described as Cyprinus amarus by Marcus Elieser Bloch in 1782, and has been referred to in scientific literature as Rhodeus sericeus amarus. It is known simply as \""the bitterling\"" in its native range, where it is the only species of its genus Rhodeus, and sometimes in the scientific literature, also, but this is technically wrong, being a leftover from the times when the European bitterling was united with its Siberian relative, the Amur bitterling, in R. sericeus. Properly, \""bitterling\"" can refer to any species of Acheilognathus or Rhodeus. The fish reaches a size of up to 10 cm (4 in). It is found among plants over sandy and muddy bottoms in shallow waters. It feeds mainly on plants, and to a lesser extent, upon worms, crustaceans, and insect larvae. This species of fish was once used for human pregnancy tests. Female specimens were injected with the urine of the woman to be tested. If the woman was pregnant, the hormones in the urine would cause the fish's ovipositors to protrude. The fish spawns in clear, slow-running or still water, often with a muddy bottom. The female deposits her eggs inside freshwater mussels. The male sheds his sperm into the inhalent current of the respiring mussel and thereby fertilizes the eggs. The young hatch and remain protected within the mussel for about a month, eventually leaving the mussel as actively swimming larvae. Both sexes reach sexual maturity in 1 year, at a length of 30 to 35 mm (1.2 to 1.4 in).",Species,Animal,Fish

As in other solifuges, mating involves the male depositing a spermatogonia that is manipulated into the female genital opening using their chelicera. The male strokes the female using the palps allowing her to be approached. Females will often feed on males before or after mating.

"The Battle of Olpae was a battle of the Peloponnesian War in 426 BC, between armies led by Athens and Sparta. In 426, 3,000 hoplites from Ambracia invaded Amphilochian Argos in Acarnania on a gulf of the Ionian Sea and occupied the fort of Olpae. The Acarnanians asked for help from both the Athenian general Demosthenes, and the 20 Athenian ships located nearby under the command of Aristotle and Hierophon. The Ambraciots asked for help from Eurylochus of Sparta, who managed to march his army past the Acarnanians without being observed. After this, Demosthenes arrived in the gulf below Olpae with his ships, 200 hoplites, and 60 archers. He joined with the Acarnanian army and set up camp in a ravine opposite Eurylochus, where both sides made preparations for five days. As the Ambraciot and Peloponnesian army was larger, Demosthenes set up an ambush with 400 hoplites from Acarnania, to be used when the battle began. Demosthenes formed the right wing of the Athenian-led army with Athenian and Messenian troops, with the centre and left wing formed by the Acarnanians and Amphilochians. Eurylochus formed the left wing of his army, directly facing Demosthenes, with the Ambraciots and Mantineans forming the rest of the line. When the battle began, Eurylochus quickly outflanked Demosthenes and was about to surround him when the Acarnanians began their ambush, causing panic among the other troops when Eurylochus was killed. The Ambraciots defeated the left wing of the Acarnanians and Amphilochians, chasing them back to Argos, but they were themselves defeated by the rest of the Acarnanians when they returned. Demosthenes lost about 300 men, but emerged victorious when the battle was completed later that night. The next day, Menedaius, who had taken command when Eurylochus was killed, attempted to arrange a truce with Demosthenes. Demosthenes would only allow the leaders of the army to escape. This was psychological warfare by Demosthenes \""...to discredit the Lacedaemonians and Peloponnesians with the Hellenes in those parts, as traitors and self-seekers\"". However, some of the Ambraciots attempted to flee with Menedaius and the other commanders. The Acarnanians chased them, allowed Menedaius to escape as agreed, and killed about 200 Ambraciots. Meanwhile, Demosthenes learned that a second army from Ambracia was marching towards Olpae. These Ambraciots set up camp on the road to the fort at Idomene, having no knowledge of the defeat of the previous day. Demosthenes surprised them there at night, pretending to be the other Ambraciot army, and killed most of them; the rest fled to the hills or into the sea where they were captured by the 20 Athenian ships. Overall, the Ambraciots lost about 1,000 men over the two days. Although Demosthenes could have easily taken Ambracia, he did not, because his allies feared a strong Athens in that region and so the Acarnanians and Ambraciots signed a 100-year peace treaty with them.",Event,SocietalEvent,MilitaryConflict

"U.S. Route 12 (US 12) is a part of the United States Numbered Highway System that runs from Aberdeen, Washington, to Detroit, Michigan. In the U.S. state of Indiana, it is part of the state road system. US 12 enters the state concurrent with US 20 and US 41 in Whiting. The 45.16 miles (72.68 km) of US 12 that lie within Indiana serve as a major conduit. Some of the highway is listed on the National Highway System. Various sections are rural two-lane highway, urbanized four-lane undivided highway and one-way streets. The easternmost community along the highway is Michiana Shores at the Michigan state line. US 12 passes through urban areas and wood lands, parallel to the Lake Michigan shoreline. The highway is included in the Lake Michigan Circle Tour and passes through the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Historical landmarks along the highway include the Miller Town Hall, Beverly Shores South Shore Railroad Station and the Old Michigan City Lighthouse. A memorial highway designations have been applied to the route since 1917, named for the Civil War Union Army unit. US 12 was first designated as a US Highway in 1926, concurrent with US 20 west of Michigan City. A section of the highway originally served as part of the Dunes Highway, a connection between Gary and Michigan. US 12 replaced the original SR 43 designation of the highway which dated back to the formation of the Indiana state road system. SR 43 ran from the Illinois state line through Gary to Michigan City and ended at the Michigan state line. In the early 1920s, it was the most important route between Chicago and Detroit and in 1922 the first sections started being paved.

"The Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre was a major theatre of operations during the Second World War. The vast size of the Mediterranean and Middle East theatre saw interconnected naval, land, and air campaigns fought for control of the Mediterranean, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East and Southern Europe. The fighting in this theatre lasted from 10 June 1940, when Italy entered the war on the side of Nazi Germany, until 2 May 1945 when all Axis forces in Italy surrendered. However, fighting would continue in Greece – where British troops had been dispatched to aid the Greek government – during the early stages of the Greek Civil War. The British referred to this theatre as the Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre (so called due to the location of the fighting and the name of the headquarters that controlled the initial fighting: Middle East Command) while the Americans called the theatre of operations the Mediterranean Theater of War. The German official history of the fighting is dubbed The Mediterranean, South-East Europe, and North Africa 1939–1942. Regardless of the size of the theatre, the various campaigns were not seen as neatly separated areas of operations but part of one vast theatre of war. Fascist Italy aimed to carve out a new Roman Empire, while British forces aimed initially to retain the status quo. Italy launched various attacks around the Mediterranean, which were largely unsuccessful. With the introduction of German forces, Yugoslavia and Greece were overrun. Allied and Axis forces engaged in back and forth fighting across North Africa, with Axis interference in the Middle East causing fighting to spread there. With confidence high from early gains, German forces planned elaborate attacks to be launched to capture the Middle East and then to possibly attack the southern border of the Soviet Union. However, following three years of fighting, Axis forces were defeated in North Africa and their interference in the Middle East was halted. Allied forces then commenced an invasion of Southern Europe, resulting in the Italians deposing Mussolini and joining the Allies. A prolonged battle for Italy took place between Allied and German forces, and as the strategic situation changed in south-east Europe, British troops returned to Greece. The theatre of war had the longest duration of the Second World War, resulted in the destruction of the Italian Empire and altered the strategic position of Germany, resulting in German divisions being deployed to Africa and Italy and total losses (including those captured upon final surrender) being over half a million. Italian losses amounted to around 177,000 men with a further several hundred thousand captured during the process of the various campaigns. British losses amount to over 300,000 men killed, wounded, or captured, and total American losses in the region amounted to 130,000.",Event,SocietalEvent,MilitaryConflict

He distinguished three forms of being, the sensible, the intelligible, and a third compounded of the two, to which correspond respectively, sense, intellect and opinion. Unity and duality he considered to be gods which rule the universe, and the soul is a self-moving number. God pervades all things, and there are daemonical powers, intermediate between the divine and the mortal, which consist in conditions of the soul. He held that mathematical objects and the Platonic Ideas are identical, unlike Plato who distinguished them.

"Crilly Airways Ltd was founded by entrepreneur Frederick Leo Crilly. The airline operated passenger services between several cities in England in the mid-1930s. The airline started with a capitalization of ₤12,000. Crilly Airways started up running two eight seat de Havilland Dragons from Braunstone, a suburb of Leicester. The first of these two aircraft was christened Spirit of Doncaster. They also operated a de Havilland Fox Moth and two General Aircraft Monospar twin-engined monoplanes. In 1935, Crilly Airways sought government approval to operate an air service between Britain and Ireland but was refused. It was the Irish government's intention to operate a national airline between the two countries. The airline was the first to offer a frequent-flyer programme. Crilly Airways bought four twelve-seater Fokker F.XIIs from KLM. Using these planes, the airline was the first to run an airmail service between Portugal and England, opening this service on 1 February 1936. At the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, one of the Fokker F.XIIs was christened Lisboa (\""Lisbon\"") by Menina Maria do Carmo Carmona Costa, the young granddaughter of the nation's president. It was Crilly's intention to extend this service to Gibraltar and West Africa, but this plan came to nought when the Spanish government refused the airline permission to overfly its territory during the Spanish Civil War. Unable to survive financially following the failure of the Portuguese venture, the company ceased trading on September 9, 1936 and entered receivership.

On 13 August 1951, Flight Lieutenant Quinton was a navigator with 228 Operational Conversion Unit, RAF Leeming, under instruction in a Wellington aircraft which was involved in a mid-air collision. An Air Training Corps cadet, 16-year-old Derek Coates, was with him in the rear compartment of the aircraft when the force of the impact caused the Wellington to break up and plunge to the ground out of control. Flight Lieutenant Quinton picked up the only parachute he could see, clipped it on to the cadet's harness, showed him how to pull the rip-cord and ordered him to jump. The cadet landed safely and was the only survivor of the disaster, all eight other occupants of the two planes perished. For his selfless action he was awarded the George Cross (GC), the UK's highest award for bravery by a civilian or a military person where the award of the Victoria Cross (VC) is not applicable.

He served as education minister in several administrations, and worked on the 1968 presidential campaign of Arnulfo Arias Madrid. In February 1988, Noriega promoted Solís from education minister to president after the firing of president Eric Arturo Delvalle. The US administration of president Ronald Reagan refused to recognize Solís or the diplomats representing him as legitimate. In May, the administration offered a deal in which Noriega would leave office in exchange for the US dropping drug charges against him; however, the Panamanian military rejected the terms, which gave no guarantee that Solís would retain power. Solís served until 1 September 1989, shortly before the US invasion of Panama which deposed Noriega. He was later described as one of a series of Noriega's puppet rulers, nicknamed the \""Kleenex presidents\"" in Panama due to their \""disposability\"".

"The blue rockfish, Sebastes mystinus, (also known as the blue seaperch) is a rockfish of the Pacific coast found from Alaska to Baja California. Blue rockfish have a relatively smooth and oval appearance compared to other members of Sebastes, with very few head spines. Color is a bluish black to gray, with some darker mottling, including a pair of stripes angling down and back from the eye. The terminal mouths are small for rockfish. Length ranges up to 55 to 60 cm, and weights up to 3.8 kg. They occur from Sitka Strait in the north to Punta Santo Tomas in Baja, most commonly along Oregon and northern California (records of blue rockfish in the western Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea probably refer to the related dusky rockfish.) While they have been caught at depths of over 500 m, most live near to the surface, down to 90 m. Diet is plankton. Juveniles consume tiny crustacea such as copepods and barnacle larvae (in some cases having a significant effect on the population), while adults shift to larger types, such as free-swimming tunicates, jellyfish, gastropods, squids, young rockfish, and drifting plant fragments. Blue rockfish were once an important part of the California fishery; they were the most common rockfish marketed in San Francisco and San Diego during the 19th century, but have since declined in popularity. They continue to be of interest as game fish, and are among the most common types landed by boat anglers; in fact, there is evidence of overfishing in Monterey Bay and southern California.

"The Mitsubishi 3B2 engine is a family of all-alloy three cylinder engines developed by Mitsubishi Motors, first produced in December 2005 at the company's Mizushima powertrain facility in Kurashiki, Okayama, for introduction in their 2006 Mitsubishi i kei car. All engines developed within this family have aluminum cylinder block and head, double overhead camshafts, four valves per cylinder, and MIVEC continuous variable valve timing. The preliminary version of the 659 cc engine was first seen in the \""i\"" Concept test car introduced in 2003, and used Mitsubishi's Smart Idling system which turns off the engine automatically when the vehicle is stationary, and can restart it within 0.2 seconds. So equipped, Mitsubishi claimed the prototype was capable of fulfilling the \""three litre initiative\"" for gasoline engines, meaning fuel consumption of no more than 3.0 litres per 100 kilometres (94.2 mpg, 78.4 U.S. mpg). The larger 999 cc capacity of the development engine was outside the limits of the kei class in Japan and was introduced in the second generation of the smart fortwo. The 3B20 was designed with the \""rear midship\"" layout in mind. The basic dimensions chosen reduced the powerplant's height, the cylinder block's structure was simplified, a timing chain was adopted, modularized components were used for the oil and water pumps, engine mounts, and fuel system.

"The sharp-mouthed lizard, Puerto Rican anole, or snake anole (Anolis pulchellus) is a small lizard belonging to the Anolis genus of the Polychrotidae family. The species, the most common lizard in Puerto Rico, is also native to Vieques, Culebra, and the Virgin Islands (except St. Croix). The sharp-mouthed Lizard measures approximately 1.3 to 1.6 inches (35 to 43 mm) in length from snout to vent. The species has a yellow-brown color with males having a purple dewlap that blends into crimson near the tip. The Anolis lizards of the Greater Antilles have been extensively studied since they represent an interesting case of adaptive radiation. Species are more closely related to other species within the same island than to species of adjacent islands. Surprisingly, even though species divergence occurred independently on each island, the same set of ecomorphs (habitat specialists) have evolved on each island.

The Utila iguana is the only species of iguana and one of only two species of lizard to exclusively inhabit brackish mangrove swamps, forced there due to competition from larger species. It is the smallest of the three species of iguana found on Utila, and unique among spiny-tailed iguanas as it is born a dark color as opposed to bright green or yellow. It is arboreal and primarily herbivorous, although it can be an opportunistic carnivore. Males may grow up to 76 centimeters (30 in) in length, while females are smaller, with a length of up to 56 centimeters (22 in). Eggs are laid in sandy beaches and hatch about 60–76 days later, with the hatchlings returning to live in the mangrove forests. Brought to the brink of extinction by the 1990s due to hunting, it was brought back to international attention by German herpetologist Dr. Gunther Köhler and his book Reptiles of Central America. Although several zoos and wildlife associations have instituted programs for the iguanas on Utila, the species still finds itself threatened due to overhunting and may face more of a threat in the form of habitat loss.

"The Sierra Madre ground warbler (Robsonius thompsoni) is a bird species that was discovered on the Luzon Island in the Philippines by the University of Kansas research team. This new species is named after Max Thompson, a retired professor from Southwestern College and a research associate in the Biodiversity Institute at the University of Kansas. They feed on insects, and tend to live in tropical understories. Some taxonomists continue to list the species in the Timaliidae, others in the Pellorneidae. Current studies suggest placement in the Locustellidae. They’re ground-walking songbirds — rotund, with strong legs and weak wings — and it appears that they can barely fly. They tend to inhabit dense forest understory, where they feed on insects. Their song is extremely high in pitch, and ventriloquial — it is almost impossible to locate the source of the sound in the forest — they always sound like they are far away, even when they are almost at your feet. The bird looks similar to the other two species of ground warblers in the Philippines, the Bicol ground warbler and the Cordillera ground warbler, so it was not recognized as an independent species at first. The three species of ground warblers are identical in size, shape, and juvenile plumage coloration, but they differ from one another in adult plumage coloration, as discovered by University of Kansas biologist, Pete Hosner. Since they are so alike they were always thought to be the same species. Once a DNA test was conducted it became very obvious that these species were not the same. One way to tell the difference between a Bicol ground warbler or a Cordillera ground warbler and a Sierra Madre ground warbler is that the plumage of an adult bird is variegated brown, gray and red. The Sierra Madre ground warbler is 20 centimeters long with relatively long legs.",Species,Animal,Bird

Also proposed was an outdoor 1.7-kilometre (1.1 mi) closed road circuit race track and a mountain bike skills area which would have been built on The Sanctuary Bird Reserve and LNR. A coalition of 16 local wildlife conservation groups expressed concern at the proposal, but it was approved in February 2014.

(See also the GNIS link here.) They are a sub-range of the Bitterroot Range, and divide Beaverhead County, Montana from Lemhi County, Idaho and Clark County, Idaho. The Beaverheads encompass an area of 4,532 square miles (11,738 km2). They lie to the east of the Bitterroot Mountains, to the south-west of the Big Hole Basin and the Pioneer Mountains and to the west of the Centennial Mountains. Passes in the mountains include Lemhi Pass, Bannock Pass, Big Hole Pass, Big Hole Pass II, Junction Pass and Monida Pass. The Beaverheads are further subdivided into the West Big Hole Mountains, the Big Hole Divide, the Tendoy Mountains, the Italian Peaks, and the Garfield Peaks. The mountains take their name from Beaverhead Rock, to the north of the mountains. Major summits in the Beaverheads include Garfield Mountain (10,961 ft) and Eighteenmile Peak (11,141 ft). The Beaverheads contain two large roadless areas, one predominantly in Montana and the other predominantly in Idaho. The West Big Hole roadless area is mostly in Montana and is about 215,000 acres in size. It includes parts of the Beaverhead National Forest in Montana and the Salmon National Forest in Idaho, and ranges in elevation from 4,500 feet on the Salmon River in Idaho to 10,620 feet at Homer Youngs Peak in Montana. Rugged peaks, semiarid foothills on the Idaho side, and extensive conifer forests on the Montana side provide habitat for a large elk herd that winters in Idaho and summers in Montana. The Montana side drains into the Big Hole River, a blue-ribbon trout stream. Marshy glacial valleys on the Montana portion constitute some of the best moose habitat in the state. Other wildlife includes black bear, mountain goat, bighorn sheep, lynx, marten, and deer. The other large roadless area is mainly in Idaho and is centered on the Italian Peaks portion of the range.

"Chaul is a former city of Portuguese India, now in ruins. It is located 60 km south of Mumbai, in Raigad District of Maharashtra state in western India. In 1508, the Egyptian Mamluks, allied with the Gujarat Sultanate vanquished the Portuguese in the Battle of Chaul. The first Portuguese settlement at Chaul took place in 1521 with the construction of the first fort on the south bank of the Kundalika River. In October 1531, the Portuguese erected a new square stone fortress, named Santa Maria do Castello, which contained a church and dwellings for 120 men. A town developed around the fortress, but a 1558 treaty precluded fortifying the town. The town was destroyed in a 1570-71 siege by the Nizam Shahi Sultan of Ahmadnagar, but a treaty was concluded which lifted the siege, and the town was rebuilt and surrounded by walls and bastions. A fort (Korlai fort) was built on the Morro de Chaul, a rocky promontory on the north side of the river opposite the town. The town withstood several further attacks, and its defence works were expanded in 1613. Chaul was part of Portuguese India's Northern Province, which by the mid 17th century extended for 100 km along the coast of present-day Maharashtra and Gujarat, from Chaul in the south to Daman in the north. The headquarters of the northern province was at Baçaim (modern Vasai) north of Bombay. During the later 17th and early 18th centuries Portuguese India declined economically and politically, and Chaul lost its former importance. As the power of the Mughal Empire declined in the early 18th century, the Marathas expanded their control of central and western India. The Portuguese colony of Kalyan was captured by the Marathas in 1720, and in 1737 the Maratha general Angria began a concerted campaign to capture the remaining Portuguese territories. Chaul and the Morro de Chaul came under siege in March 1739, but the siege was raised in October. After the capture of Baçaim in 1740, a peace treaty was concluded, and on 18 September 1740, Chaul was ceded by treaty to the Marathas. The city was subsequently abandoned and left in ruins. The village of Korlai, near the ruins of Chaul, is still home to speakers of Portuguese Creole.",Place,Settlement,Town

"Restaurant The House of Lords is a former restaurant located in The Hague, Netherlands. It was a fine dining restaurant that was awarded one Michelin star in the period 1960-1975. The head chef responsible for the Michelin star was Alfons Didde. In strange twist of fate, in was the House of Commons that sealed the fate of The House of Lords. The restaurant was one of the victims of the renewal of the parliamentary buildings in The Hague and was demolished in 1986.The original frontage is now on display in the Louwman Museum. The director of the museum was a regular visitor of the restaurant and found that the front needed to be preserved for historical reasons. He could justify that because of sign of the Koninklijke Nederlandsche Automobiel Club (Royal Dutch Automobile Club) adjacent to the front door. Due to the large number of parliamentarians frequenting the restaurant, it was also the place for politic intrigue.

"Tetraophasis is a genus of Galliform in the family Phasianidae, which includes pheasants, Perdixs, grouse, turkeyss, tragopan, and koklass. It contains the following species: \n*  chestnut-throated monal-partridge (Tetraophasis obscurus) \n*  buff-throated monal-partridge (Tetraophasis szechenyii) The name Tetraophasis is a combination of the genus name Tetrao (the name Carl Linnaeus gave grouse in 1758), and the modern Latin word phasis, meaning \""pheasant\"". Monal-partridge are close relatives of monals and more distantly related to tragopan. They are boreal adapted species of high altitudes. Like monals they dig in alpine biomes for tubers, rhizomes and invertebrates as well as rodent pups and voles. Monal-partridges are important prey species for raptors, owls and yellow-throated martens. Like monals, monal-partridges are strictly monogamous. The female incubates the eggs until the last 48 hours when the male may take over night time nest brooding. This is a habit documented in blood pheasants, tragopans and monals. Both sexes rear the chicks, which are not fully mature until their second year. Unlike monals the sexes do not separate during winter. Monal-partridges are strong fliers. They evidently compete with koklass as the two are rarely to be heard or seen in the same valleys.",Species,Animal,Bird

"The Nigerian Armed Forces are the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Its origins lie in the elements of the Royal West African Frontier Force that became Nigerian when independence was granted in 1960. In 1956 the Nigeria Regiment of the Royal West African Frontier Force (RWAFF) was renamed the Nigerian Military Forces, RWAFF, and in April 1958 the colonial government of Nigeria took over from the British War Office control of the Nigerian Military Forces. Since its creation the Nigerian military has fought in a civil war – the conflict with Biafra in 1967–70 – and sent peacekeeping forces abroad both with the United Nations and as the backbone of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) in Liberia and Sierra Leone. It has also seized power twice at home (1966 & 1983). In the aftermath of the civil war, the much expanded size of the military, around 250,000 in 1977, consumed a large part of Nigeria’s resources under military rule for little productive return. The great expansion of the military during the civil war further entrenched the existing military hold on Nigerian society carried over from the first military regime. In doing so, it played an appreciable part in reinforcing the military’s nearly first-among-equals status within Nigerian society, and the linked decline in military effectiveness.

"The red-throated ant tanager (Habia fuscicauda) is a medium-sized passerine bird. This species is a resident breeder on the Caribbean slopes from southeastern Mexico to eastern Panama. It was usually considered an aberrant kind of tanager and placed in the Thraupidae, but is actually closer to the cardinals (Cardinalidae). Consequently, it can be argued that referring to the members of this genus as ant tanagers is misleading, but no other common name has gained usage. Red-throated ant tanagers are 19 cm (7.5 in) long and weigh 40 g (1.4 oz). Adult males are dull dusky red, somewhat paler below, and with a bright red throat and central crown. The female is brownish olive, paler and greyer below, and with a yellow throat and small dull yellow crown stripe. Young birds are brown and lack the throat and crown patches. Both sexes of this species are duller and darker than the related red-crowned ant tanager which occurs on the Pacific slope in its Central American range. It occurs in thick undergrowth at the edge of forest, second growth or abandoned plantations at altitudes from sea level to 600 m (2,000 ft). The large but untidy cup nest is usually built 1–3 m (3.3–9.8 ft) high in the fork of a shrub or tree, and is often decorated with living ferns. The normal clutch is two or three white eggs laid from April to June. These birds are found in pairs or small groups. They eat insects, arthropods and fruit like those of Cymbopetalum mayanum (Annonaceae), and less often Trophis racemosa (Moraceae), and will follow army ant columns especially in lowlands where antbirds are uncommon. The flock will give a defensive spread-wing-and-tail display to deter potential predators. There are six known subspecies: \n*  H. f. salvini – (von Berlepsch, 1883): found from eastern Mexico to El Salvador \n*  H. f. insularis – (Salvin, 1888): found in the Yucatan Peninsula (southeastern Mexico) and northern Guatemala \n*  H. f. discolor – (Ridgway, 1901): found in northeastern, central and eastern Nicaragua \n*  H. f. fuscicauda – (Cabanis, 1861): nominate, found from southern Nicaragua to western Panama \n*  H. f. willisi – Parkes, 1969: found in central Panama \n*  H. f. erythrolaema – (Sclater, PL, 1862): found in northern Colombia",Species,Animal,Bird

"The 2013 D.C. United season was the club's eighteenth, and their eighteenth season in Major League Soccer, the top division of American soccer. The regular season began on March 2 and concluded on October 27. Outside of MLS play, the club competed in the U.S. Open Cup. Also, for the first time in their history, they played in the Walt Disney World Pro Soccer Classic, a preseason tournament to be held in February, after participating in the Carolina Challenge Cup for the past five seasons.

"The Brazilian Court Hotel is a historic luxury hotel in Palm Beach, Florida, United States which opened on New Year's Day in 1926. The National Trust for Historic Preservation accepted The Brazilian Court Hotel to be part of the Historic Hotels of America. In 1924 and 1925 two New York investors, Joseph D'Esterre and Stanley Paschal assembled the site of The Brazilian Court, at that time occupied by a few bungalows. They retained a rising young designer with whom Paschal had worked on apartment house projects in New York – Rosario Candela. Candela, born in Sicily, arrived in the United States in the 1910s speaking only a few words of English. But by 1925 he was one of the top apartment house designers in New York, with a score of luxury buildings on Park and Fifth Avenues to his credit. Candela used a Mediterranean design for The Brazilian Court, with tinted, rough stucco, classical details and tiled roofs. Candela developed a simple courtyard model which emphasized the inner face of the building, rather than the street façade. It was organized as an apartment hotel, with small kitchens for the meals that guests chose not to take outside. In 2003, Obadon Hotels purchased The Brazilian Court, and renovated it from the formal setting of the 1920s to a more cosmopolitan style. In doing so, the kitchenettes were removed, and in their place opened a restaurant, Cafe Boulud, under the James Beard Award nominee, Chef Daniel Boulud. The hotel is located at 301 Australian Avenue. It is a National Trust for Historic Preservation and a Leading Hotel of the World.

"John Ker, 3rd Duke of Roxburghe KG, KT, PC (23 April 1740 – 1804) was a Scottish nobleman and bibliophile. Born in Hanover Square, London, on 23 April 1740, Ker succeeded his father to become the 3rd Duke of Roxburghe in 1755. During his Grand Tour in 1761 he fell in love with Christina Sophia Albertina, oldest daughter of the Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. This would have been a perfect match of social equals. Shortly afterwards a younger sister, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, became engaged to King George III. It was considered bad etiquette for an elder sister to marry someone of lower rank than a younger sister. For whatever reason, both John Ker and Christina separated and remained single for the rest of their lives. If George III recognised the sacrifice that Ker had made, it was rewarded with a high position at court. He was Lord of the Bedchamber from 1767, was appointed a Knight of the Thistle in 1768. In 1796 he was appointed Groom of the Stole and made a Privy Counsellor. He was appointed a Knight of the Garter in 1801. While in Italy, Ker saw a first edition of Boccaccio's Decameron, often called the Valdarfers edition. This was a fabled book, which many said did not exist. He paid 100 guineas for it and showed it to his friends in London to huge acclaim. For the next 40 years he collected ancient and curious books, particularly editions of Shakespeare's works and other works which merely mentioned Shakespeare. At his death in 1804 there were 10,000 items. Most were books, but there were also pamphlets and broadside ballad sheets. His library was auctioned in 1812, leading to the formation of the Roxburghe Club. His collection of ballads were later published as the Roxburghe Ballads.

"The rufous-naped wren (Campylorhynchus rufinucha) is a songbird of the Troglodytidae family, the wrens. It is a resident breeding species from central-southwest Mexico to northwestern Costa Rica. This large wren breeds in lowlands and foothills from sea level up to 800 m (2,600 ft) altitude in forest or open woodland, scrub, second growth and savanna. It is found mainly on the Pacific side of the central mountain ranges. Its spherical nest has a side entrance and is lined with seed down. It is constructed 1.5 to 8 m (4.9–26.2 ft) high in thorny trees or shrubs, especially bull’s-horn acacia. This species sometimes nests close to the nests of wasps and there is experimental evidence that those that do so are afforded substantial protection from predation by doing so. The female alone incubates the three to five brown- or black-spotted white eggs for about two weeks until hatching, and the young fledge after about the same length of time again. After breeding, families sleep together in dormitory nests like those used for breeding. The adult rufous-naped wren is 17 cm (6.7 in) long and weighs 36 g (1.3 oz). It has a black crown and eyestripe separated by a strong white supercilium, a rufous nape, and cinnamon-brown upperparts streaked with black and white, especially on the rump. The wings and tail are barred with black and greyish-white. The underparts are white. Young birds have duller upperparts and buff underparts. This species has a short rasping call. The song is a mix of rich whistles, chatters and gurgles often given as a duet. The rufous-naped wren forages actively in low vegetation in pairs or family groups. It eats mainly insects, spiders and other invertebrates. This species is often tame and inquisitive. Three main populations vary markedly in size and coloration, and may represent separate species: Veracruz wren (restricted to central coastal Veracruz), rufous-naped wren (north and west from western Chiapas), and rufous-backed wren (south and east from western Chiapas).",Species,Animal,Bird

"Wilhelm (later William) Steinitz (May 17, 1836 – August 12, 1900) was an Austrian and later American chess Master player, and the first undisputed world chess champion from 1886 to 1894. He was also a highly influential writer and chess theoretician. When discussing chess history from the 1850s onwards, commentators have debated whether Steinitz could be effectively considered the champion from an earlier time, perhaps as early as 1866. Steinitz lost his title to Emanuel Lasker in 1894, and also lost a rematch in 1896–97. Statistical rating systems give Steinitz a rather low ranking among world champions, mainly because he took several long breaks from competitive play. However, an analysis based on one of these rating systems shows that he was one of the most dominant players in the history of the game. Steinitz was unbeaten in match play for 32 years, from 1862 to 1894. Although Steinitz became \""world number one\"" by winning in the all-out attacking style that was common in the 1860s, he unveiled in 1873 a new positional style of play, and demonstrated that it was superior to the previous style. His new style was controversial and some even branded it as \""cowardly\"", but many of Steinitz's games showed that it could also set up attacks as ferocious as those of the old school. Steinitz was also a prolific writer on chess, and defended his new ideas vigorously. The debate was so bitter and sometimes abusive that it became known as the \""Ink War\"". Steinitz was the target of anti-Semitic abuse, and moved to the United States to escape this. By the early 1890s, Steinitz's approach was widely accepted, and the next generation of top players acknowledged their debt to him, most notably his successor as world champion, Emanuel Lasker. As a result of the \""Ink War\"", traditional accounts of Steinitz's character depict him as ill-tempered and aggressive; but more recent research shows that he had long and friendly relationships with some players and chess organizations. Most notably from 1888 to 1889 he co-operated with the American Chess Congress in a project to define rules governing the conduct of future world championships. Steinitz was unskilled at managing money, and lived in poverty all his life.",Agent,Athlete,ChessPlayer

"Hurley Burley (born 1895) was an American Thoroughbred race horse. Her breeder and owner was Ed Corrigan who raced out of the old Washington Park Race Track in Chicago, Illinois. In Corrigan’s time, he was the most powerful man in mid-Western racing. Known as the \""stormy petrel\"" of the American Turf, Corrigan was the subject of many articles about him (the Kansas City Times, the Courier-Journal, The Louisville Times, to name only a few), all attesting to his murderous temper as well as his loyalty to those he liked. Corrigan campaigned the great filly Modesty, winner of the 1884 Kentucky Oaks as well as building the Hawthorne Race Course in Chicago. Hurley Burley was by Riley who had won the 1890 Kentucky Derby for Corrigan and was a son of the great stallion Longfellow. (Riley was originally called “Shortfellow.”) Her dam was Helter Skelter, a good racing mare also running under the Corrigan colors. Corrigan raced Hurley Burley as a selling plater, meaning she competed only in claiming races. As a claimer, she could be bought by a trainer right out of the race. In about 1898, Corrigan claimed a horse the eventual Hall of Fame trainer Sam Hildreth was running. Miffed at the loss of a horse he liked, Lucky Dog, Hildreth retaliated by claiming Corrigan’s Hurley Burley for $1,500. His claim wasn’t merely to get back at Corrigan though; he’d seen something in the chestnut plater. Under Hildreth’s colors, Hurley Burley stepped up in class in the racing world. She won nine of her thirteen starts for him, set a Washington Park track record for six furlongs and also one for one mile and twenty yards. Lew Fields and his theatrical partner Joe Weber liked the increasingly popular filly’s name, so asked Hildreth if they could use it for a new musical. They liked the name of her dam as well, so used that too, Helter Skelter. When she retired from the track, Hildreth sold her for $10,000 to William Collins Whitney. As a broodmare, Hurley Burley was as good as she was a racehorse. Her best foal was the 1906 Belmont Stakes winner, Burgomaster out of the Whitney owned Hamburg. He was also the American Horse of the Year in 1906. Her birthplace and date of death is, so far, unknown.",Species,Horse,RaceHorse

"In 1965, the United States rapidly increased its military forces in South Vietnam, prompted by the realization that the South Vietnamese government was losing the Vietnam War as the communist-dominated Viet Cong gained influence over much of the population in rural areas of the country. North Vietnam also rapidly increased its infiltration of men and supplies to combat South Vietnam and the U.S. The objective of the U.S. and South Vietnam was to prevent a communist take-over. North Vietnam and the insurgent Viet Cong sought to unite the two sections of the country. Political instability and internal dissent continued to plague the government of South Vietnam although in June General Nguyễn Văn Thiệu and Air Marshall Nguyễn Cao Kỳ took control of the country and remained in power for the remainder of the year. In the United States, a majority of Congress and the people supported U.S. participation in the war although protests against the war became larger and more frequent, especially among college students. The U.S. began bombing North Vietnam in March in Operation Rolling Thunder. The U.S. Army and Marines began ground operations to ferret out and defeat the communist forces. General William Westmoreland commanded U.S. forces in South Vietnam. Westmoreland's strategy was attrition, employing U.S. superiority in firepower, technology, and mobility. The usual military tactic of the United States was search and destroy operations in which large U.S. and South Vietnamese units, supported by air and artillery, swept through an area to attempt to engage the communists in battle. North Vietnam and the Viet Cong, by contrast, relied on hit-and-run operations and ambushes, avoiding set-piece battles except at their own initiative. In November the U.S. and North Vietnamese armies met head-on for the first time in the Battle of Ia Drang. Both sides claimed victory. The U.S. inflicted heavy casualties on the North Vietnamese, but the battle vindicated the conviction by North Vietnam that its military could slowly grind down the U.S.'s commitment to the war. South Korea contributed an army division to South Vietnam and Australia, New Zealand and other countries provided smaller numbers of soldiers. North Vietnam received military aid from the Soviet Union and China. At year's end, President Lyndon Johnson declared a temporary halt to the bombing of North Vietnam and undertook a diplomatic initiative to seek negotiations with North Vietnam. North Vietnam, on its part, aimed to achieve a decisive military victory, but prepared also for an expanded war if the U.S. continued to escalate its involvement.

The ʻelepaio is the first native bird to sing in the morning and the last to stop singing at night; apart from whistled and chattering contact and alarm calls, it is probably best known for its song, from which derives the common name: a pleasant and rather loud warble which sounds like e-le-PAI-o or ele-PAI-o. It nests between January and June. The species are: \n* Hawaiʻi ʻelepaio, Chasiempis sandwichensis \n* O'ahu ʻelepaio, Chasiempis ibidis \n* Kauaʻi ʻelepaio, Chasiempis sclateri",Species,Animal,Bird

"Snell's Bridge is an historic bridge over the Patuxent River near Fulton, Maryland. Farms surrounding the bridge were surveyed as early as 1720. In 1777, George Snell was considered the owner of the bridge by Montgomery County with George Darby listed as the road overseer. In November 1787, the State of Maryland funded a fifty-foot wide road to be built from Snell's Bridge and Greens Bridge upstream to Ellicott's Mills. Richard Green, Nathanial Owen, and John Ellicott were appointed commissioners for the project. The land next to the bridge is the birthplace of the Whig Major who ordered the Peggy Stuart burned. During the British invasion of the War of 1812, American troops led by William H. Winder retreated across Snell's Bridge on August 26, 1814. The President stayed at Brookville, with the disorganized troops gathering at the bridge for the night. After camping overnight at the bridge, the General concluded that he should proceed directly to Baltimore in case the British were advancing northward leaving Brigadier General Stansbury in charge of the troops at camp. The British were at the same time leaving Washington, and boarded ships to sail the Potomac and Chesapeake toward Baltimore. In the 1840s, the state funded a replacement to Snell's Bridge. The modern bridge is a concrete arch built in 1928 along with the widening of route 108 in Howard County. The bridge replacement was funded via the 1920 Lateral and Post Roads Act. A historical survey was conducted in 1995 without mention of the bridge's role in the War of 1812.",Place,RouteOfTransportation,Bridge

Birch was always on the fringes of the United first team, but apart from a spell midway through the 1950–51 season in which he scored four goals in nine appearances, he never lived up to his potential and was sold to Wolverhampton Wanderers for £10,000 towards the end of the 1951–52 season. His tenure at Wolves was short, however, and he was transferred to Lincoln City after just nine months in the West Midlands. In three years with Lincoln, Birch played in more than fifty matches, scoring 15 goals. He then dropped out of league football for a season in 1955, joining Boston United, before moving to Barrow in 1956.

"The Green Party of England and Wales leadership election, 2012 took place in August and September 2012. The party has elections every two years for Leader and Deputy Leader roles and this is the third election since the party decided to switch from having principal speakers to having a leader and a deputy leader, or co-leaders. In May 2012, Caroline Lucas announced that she would not seek re-election, hoping that instead other talented individuals could rise to the top of the party. This was an unexpected development for most Green Party members, and is remarkable in being the only time in recent British political history that a party leader has stepped down voluntarily and without pressure from inside the party. Subsequently, four candidates announced that they would seek to take over from Lucas. These are: \n* Pippa Bartolotti - current leader of Wales Green Party from Newport  \n* Natalie Bennett - former editor of Guardian Weekly from Camden, London  \n* Peter Cranie - a lecturer from Liverpool  \n* Romayne Phoenix - former teacher & Chair of the Coalition of Resistance from Lewisham, London. The incumbent Deputy Leader, Adrian Ramsay, who was widely expected to contest the election for Leader of the party announced that would not stand in that election, nor for re-election as Deputy Leader. Four candidates were successfully nominated for the election for Deputy Leader, these being:Caroline Allen - a vet from Islington, London;Will Duckworth - a local councillor & former teacher from Dudley; Richard Mallender - a local councillor & local council worker from Nottingham;Alexandra Phillips - a local councillor & teacher from Brighton and Hove. All members of the party were sent ballot papers in the post with their copy of the party's magazine, 'Green World' at the beginning of August 2012 and had to be returned before 31 August 2012.

"The yellow-green vireo (Vireo flavoviridis) is a small passerine bird. It breeds from southern Texas (occasionally the Rio Grande Valley) in the United States and the western and eastern mountain ranges of northern Mexico (the Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre Oriental—also the Cordillera Neovolcanica) south to central Panama. It is migratory, wintering in the northern and eastern Andes and the western Amazon Basin. The adult yellow-green vireo is 14–14.7 cm in length and weighs 18.5 g. It has olive-green upperparts and a dusky-edged gray crown. There is a dark line from the bill to the red-brown eyes, and a white supercilium. The underparts are white with yellow breast sides and flanks. Young birds are duller with brown eyes, a brown tint to the back, and less yellow on the underparts. The adult yellow-green vireo differs from the red-eyed vireo in its much yellower underparts, lack of a black border to the duller gray crown, yellower upperparts and different eye color. Some individuals are difficult to separate, even in the hand, from the similar red-eyed vireo, with which it is sometimes considered conspecific. Its exact status as a passage bird in countries such as Venezuela is therefore uncertain. The yellow-green vireo has a nasal nyaaah call, and the song is a repetitive veree veer viree, fee’er vireo viree, shorter and faster than that of the red-eyed vireo. This species rarely sings on its wintering grounds. This vireo occurs in the canopy and middle levels of light woodland, the edges of forest, and gardens at altitudes from sea level to 1500 m. The 6.5-cm-wide cup nest is built by the female from a wide range of plant materials, and attached to a stout twig normally 1.5–3.5 m above the ground in a tree, but occasionally up to 12 m high. The normal clutch is two or three brown-marked white eggs laid from March to June and incubated by the female alone, although the male helps to feed the chicks. The breeding birds return to Central America from early February to March, and most depart southwards by mid-October. Yellow-green vireos feed on insects gleaned from tree foliage, favoring caterpillars and beetles. They also eat small fruits, including mistletoe berries, and, in winter quarters, those of Cymbopetalum mayanum (Annonaceae) and gumbo-limbo (Bursera simaruba).",Species,Animal,Bird

"In Greek mythology, Eteocles was a king of Orchomenus. The local tradition concerning him is preserved in Pausanias' Description of Greece, and runs as follows. Eteocles was the son of Andreus (himself son of the river-god Peneus) and Euippe, daughter of Leucon, and successor to his father's throne. Alternately, he was called son of the river god Cephissus (hence referred to by the patronymic Cephisiades in some poetical texts according to Pausanias). He was credited with having founded two tribes (phylae), one of which received the name Cephisias after his possible father, and the other one was named after himself. He assigned a little of his land to Almus, son of Sisyphus, who was believed to have given his name to the village Olmonas (\""Almones\"" was the alleged original form of its name). Eteocles was also said to have been the first to offer sacrifices to the Charites, and to have recognized three as the true number of the goddesses. The mythological connection between Eteocles and the Charites is confirmed by the account of Theocritus, who refers to the Charites as \""divine daughters of Eteocles\"". Strabo also credits Eteocles with founding the temple of the Charites, and mentions that Eteocles \""was the first to display both wealth and power; for he honored these goddesses either because he was successful in receiving graces, or in giving them, or both.\""",Agent,FictionalCharacter,MythologicalFigure

Contrary to most members of this family, Vyssotsky has a very rare A-type spectra. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.8–1.9 AU once every two and a half years (918 days). Its orbit is of low-eccentricity and heavily tilted towards the plane of the ecliptic. Its geometric albedo lies between 0.03 and 0.06. Photometric observations at the Palmer Divide Observatory (see video in ) in the U.S. state of Colorado in 1999 were used to build a light curve for this object. The asteroid displayed a rotation period of 3.201±0.001 hours and a brightness variation of 0.19±0.01 in magnitude. A repeated observation in 2014 gave a period of 3.205±0.003 hours. It was named in honor of Russian–American astronomer Alexander Vyssotsky (1888–1973) who joined the faculty of the University of Virginia in 1923 and stayed at the McCormick Observatory on Mount Jefferson, Virginia, for 35 years. He was active in the fields of photometry, astrometry and spectral classification.",Place,CelestialBody,Planet

"The elm cultivar Ulmus 'Scampstoniensis', the Scampston Elm or Scampston Weeping Elm, is said to have come from Scampston Hall, Yorkshire, England, before 1810. Loudon opined that a tree of the same name at the Royal Horticultural Society's Garden in 1834, 18 feet (5.5 m) high at 8 years old \""differed little from the species\"" (i.e. the smooth-leaved elm, his U. glabra [:Ulmus minor ]). Henry described the tree, from a specimen growing in Victoria Park, Bath, as \""a weeping form of U. nitens\"" [:Ulmus minor ]; however Green considered it \""probably a form of Ulmus × hollandica\"". Writing in 1831, Loudon said that the tree was supposed to have originated in America. U. minor is not, however, an American species, so if the tree was brought from America, it must originally have been taken there from Europe. There was (and is) an 'American Plantation' (or 'America Plantation') at Scampston, which may be related to this supposition. A number of old specimens of 'Scampstoniensis' in this plantation were blown down in a great gale of October 1881; younger specimens were still present at Scampston in 1911. Georg Dieck of the National Arboretum in Zöschen, Germany, considered 'Scampstoniensis' a synonym of Ulmus scabra Serpentina [see U. × hollandica 'Serpentina' ], a view rejected by Petzold, who in his Arboretum Muscaviense listed 'Scampstoniensis' separately, and by the Hortus Botanicus Leiden, which had a specimen of 'Scampstoniensis' (see below). \""From the Travemünder Nurseries we received an U. scampstoniensis, an elm with a beautiful pendulous shape,\"" wrote Petzold, \""that we distinguish from our U. montana Pendula.\""",Species,Plant,CultivatedVariety

The full title of the United Front Partnership as set out in the Agreement is United Front for the Restoration of Democracy, Good Governance, Peace, Political Stability and Economic Prosperity to Anguilla. The AUF under the political leadership of the Honourable Osbourne Fleming presented itself to the Anguilla electorate as a partnership in the campaign for the general elections held shortly thereafter, not as a traditional coalition of two political parties to contest elections. The AUF, when it took over the reins of the Anguilla Government in 2000, brought to the administration of the Government of Anguilla considerable experience gained from the participation of its elected leadership in various governments dating back to 1981. In 2000, the AUF ministers who formed the Government following the February elections had between them at least 35 years of service as ministers in various Anguilla Governments.",Agent,Organisation,PoliticalParty

"The Battle of Carham was a battle between the Kingdom of Scotland and the Northumbrians at Carham on Tweed in 1018 or possibly 1016. Astronomical events referred to in accounts of the battle would indicate 1016, rather than 1018 as the correct date. It is also sometimes known as the Battle of Coldstream, from the town of Coldstream. The battle was a victory for Máel Coluim (II) mac Cináeda described as 'Malcolm son of Cyneth, king of Scots' and Owain the Bald, King of Strathclyde over 'Huctred, son of Waldef, earl of the Northumbrians', as he was described by Symeon of Durham. The importance of the battle is a matter of controversy, especially in regard to the region of Lothian. Whereas Scottish historians hold that Lothian was won for Scotland at Carham, others led by Marjorie O. Anderson hold it was the English king Edgar the Peaceful who granted Lothian to Cináed (II) mac Maíl Coluim, King of Scots, in 973. In English sources, the Battle of Carham is not given any special significance. Still others, such as G.W.S. Barrow hold, that \""What English annalists recorded as the 'cession' of Lothian was... the recognition by a powerful but extremely remote south-country king of a long-standing fait accompli.\"" This possession by the Scots of what now constitutes the south-east of Scotland seems to have been recognized by kings of England, even when kings such as Cnut and William the Conqueror invaded, as they did not seek to take permanent control of the area. After Carham, much of present-day Scotland was under the control of the King of Scots, although Norsemen still held sway in Ross, Caithness, Sutherland, and The Isles. The Lords of Galloway remained semi-independent. Scotland or Scotia referred to what constitutes present-day Scotland north of the Forth and Clyde; it was not until the time of King Dabíd (I) mac Maíl Choluim that people in the south-east of the kingdom began to think of themselves as Scots. In his own charters (e.g. to St Cuthbert's in Edinburgh), he continued to refer to the men of Lothian as English.",Event,SocietalEvent,MilitaryConflict

"Saint Alexander of Comana (died c. 251), known as \""the charcoal burner\"", was Bishop of Comana in Pontus. Whether he was the first to occupy that see is open to discussion. The saint's curious name comes from the fact that he had, out of humility, taken up the work of burning charcoal, so as to escape worldly honors. He is noted for being exceptionally filthy and dirty . He is called a philosopher, but it is not certain that the term is to be taken literally. His philosophy consisted rather in his preference of heavenly to earthly things. The discovery of his virtues was due to the contempt with which he had been regarded. St. Gregory Thaumaturgus had been asked to come to Comana to help select a bishop for that place. As he rejected all the candidates, someone in derision suggested that he might accept Alexander, the charcoal-burner. Gregory took the suggestion seriously, summoned Alexander, and found that he had to do with a saint and a man of great capabilities. Alexander was made bishop of the see, administered it with wisdom and was burned to death in the persecution of Diocletian.

"Crater Lake (Klamath: giiwas) is a caldera lake in the western United States, located in south-central Oregon. It is the main feature of Crater Lake National Park and is famous for its deep blue color and water clarity. The lake partly fills a nearly 2,148-foot (655 m)-deep caldera that was formed around 7,700 (± 150) years agoby the collapse of the volcano Mount Mazama. There are no rivers flowing into or out of the lake; the evaporation is compensated for by rain and snowfall at a rate such that the total amount of water is replaced every 250 years. With a depth of 1,949 feet (594 m), the lake is the deepest in the United States. In the world, it ranks tenth for maximum depth, and third for mean (average) depth. Crater Lake is also known for the \""Old Man of the Lake\"", a full-sized tree which is now a stump that has been bobbing vertically in the lake for over a century. The low temperature of the water has slowed the decomposition of the wood, hence the longevity of the bobbing tree. Two islands are in Crater Lake: Wizard Island, formed from a cinder cone that erupted after Crater Lake began to fill with water, and the smaller Phantom Ship, which has seven trees living on it. There are also colonies of violet-green swallows and several varieties of wildflowers and lichens living there. While having no indigenous fish population, the lake was stocked from 1888 to 1941 with a variety of fish. Several species have formed self-sustaining populations.Since 2002, one of the state's regular-issue license plate designs has featured Crater Lake.The commemorative Oregon State Quarter, which was released by the United States Mint in 2005, features an image of Crater Lake on its reverse.",Place,BodyOfWater,Lake

The interior is faced with smooth grey ashlar with Bath stone decoration, and the nave is well-lit by the large, high-positioned east windows. The nave has an open timber roof while the chancel has a painted and panelled ceiling. The chancel floor is tiled in green and white. The baptismal font is a finely-carved ashlar bowl standing on marble legs.

They represent a well-distinct lineage of terror birds, differing from the massive large groups and the smaller Psilopterinae. In general proportions, they most resembled the Patagornithinae which flourished somewhat earlier, mainly to the south of the range of Mesembriornis. Two species are nowadays accepted, Mesembriornis incertus and Mesembriornis milneedwardsi. However, this was recently disputed by an author who claimed Mesembriornis to be a nomen nudum , renamed the genus Hermosiornis and proposed a new taxonomic systematics for the family.

Bred by Woodvale Farm in Kentucky, he was out of the mare Our Page, winner of the historic Spinaway Stakes in 1942 and a daughter of the 1929 American Horse of the Year and U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Blue Larkspur. He was sired by Calumet Farm's Bull Lea, a five-time North American Champion Sire. Conformation defects resulted in Bull Page being sold at the 1948 Keeneland July sale for $38,000, a relatively low price for a Bull Lea colt whose son Citation had just won the U.S. Triple Crown. Purchased by Ontario horseman, E. P. Taylor, Bull Page was conditioned by future Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame trainer Gordon J. McCann, who took over his training on the retirement of another Hall of Fame trainer, Bert Alexandra. Blessed with natural speed, the colt had health problems that kept him off the racetrack until age three, when he began racing in the early part of the year in Florida, earning his first win at Gulfstream Park. Sent north, Bull Page won two allowance races at Jamaica Racetrack in New York City. As a four-year-old in 1951, Bull Page won two important races in Toronto: the Autumn Stakes at Woodbine Park, and the Canadian International Championship at Long Branch Race Track.

Gormley had recently graduated from NIDA when she secured the role of Bianca, who was introduced as the sister of fellow new character April Scott (Rhiannon Fish). Bianca debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 9 July 2010. Bianca is the daughter of an Italian father and Australian mother. She retains certain Italian traits as she is characterised as a \""fiery, opinionated, beautiful, sophisticated\"" female. Gormley has said that Bianca puts up a feisty attitude to hide her \""softer side\"". Bianca's vice has often been powerful men who break her heart. She arrives in Summer Bay to \""nurse a broken heart\"" after her fiancé, Prince Vittorio Seca (Richard Brancatisano) is unfaithful to her. Bianca can speak English, Italian and French; she secures employment as a language teacher. She soon meets Liam Murphy (Axle Whitehead). Initially, Bianca does not find happiness with Liam as the serial implemented a \""love-triangle storyline\"", which sees Vittorio return in hope of a reconciliation. This results in Bianca becoming confused as to which man she should be with. The storyline cumulated in the programme's annual cliff-hanger episode where she chooses Liam. Their relationship is a main focus for Bianca's storyline during the early 2011 quarter. However, Liam's drug addiction weakens their relationship. The serial introduced an issue lead storyline for Bianca, in which she becomes drunk and is sexually assaulted by a mystery assailant. The storyline raised awareness of the outcome that binge drinking can hold. Bianca's ordeal ruined her romance with Liam. Other storylines included a friendship with Gypsy Nash (Kimberley Cooper) and an attraction to local \""bad boy\"" Heath Braxton (Dan Ewing). In late 2011 Bianca featured in a plot in which she fabricates the scene of the car accident and lies to the police. After marrying Liam, Bianca learned she was pregnant with Heath's child. Bianca and Liam ended their marriage and Bianca began a relationship with Heath. Their son died of sudden infant death syndrome, causing Bianca to turn to drugs to block out the pain. She and Heath later married. Some critics from publications such as TV Week and Holy Soap praised Bianca's introduction – stating that she \""made an impression\"" and \""impact\"" on Home and Away. Her relationship with Liam has proved popular with certain critics. However, Jaci Stephen from the Daily Mail has claimed that Bianca was not good for Liam's drug addiction and accused her of breaking Heath's heart.

"Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. Although only one-eighth the average density of Earth, with its larger volume Saturn is just over 95 times more massive. Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture; its astronomical symbol (♄) represents the god's sickle. Saturn's interior is probably composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). This core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally outside the Frenkel line a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. Electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h (500 m/s), higher than on Jupiter, but not as high as those on Neptune. Saturn has a prominent ring system that consists of nine continuous main rings and three discontinuous arcs and that is composed mostly of ice particles with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust.

"The Beardslee trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus f. beardsleei), formerly Salmo gairdneri beardsleei) is a local form of rainbow trout endemic to Lake Crescent in Washington. By some sources, they are treated as a subspecies. Known to locals as \""bluebacks\"", Beardslee trout are found nowhere else, and spawn in the Lyre River, near the outlet of the lake. Beardslee are somewhat difficult to distinguish from the Lake Crescent cutthroat trout, which is also endemic to Lake Crescent, as they only take on the Rainbow colors during spawning. The spawning grounds of the Beardslee (considered the rarest salmonid in the Olympic National Park) are severely threatened by siltation, and the degradation of logjams in the river used as spawning grounds. Responding to a proposal from Washington Trout, Olympic National Park has announced an emergency change to fishing regulations on Lake Crescent. On May 24 (2002), Park Superintendent David Morris announced that Lake Crescent and all its tributaries will be open for catch and release angling only. The rule change prohibits the use of down riggers, and requires that anglers use only artificial lures with single barbless hooks and no more than two ounces of weight. The emergency rule took effect June 1, the day the lake opened for fishing. The new rules are designed to protect Lake Crescent’s population of Beardslee rainbow trout, which has declined to a critically low level. Beardslee trout are a unique form of rainbow trout, native to Lake Crescent, and found nowhere else on earth. They spawn in late winter and early spring in only one small area of the Lyre River, near the outlet of the lake. Washington Trout conducted independent spawning surveys on the Lyre this past spring and found alarming evidence of very low numbers of spawning fish, indicating that the population has experienced a severe decline.

"Matthew Martyn Baldwin (born May 3, 1926) is a Canadian curler from Edmonton. Baldwin is a three-time Brier champion, having skipped his rink to the Canadian men's championship in 1954, 1957 and 1958. In 1954, Baldwin and his team of Glenn Gray, Pete Ferry and Jim Collins finished with a 9-1 record to claim their first Brier. At age 27, Baldwin was then the youngest skip to win a Brier, in an era when teams were generally led by men decades older. He is also remembered for pleasing a cheering Edmonton hometown crowd by sliding halfway down the sheet of ice when throwing his final rock of the event, a move that was legal under the curling rules of the time. The age record has since been broken; Kerry Burtnyk is the current holder of the mark. As of the 2013 event Baldwin is the oldest surviving Brier champion skip. In 1956, Baldwin returned to the Brier, but his team of Gord Haynes. Art Kleinmeyer and Bill Henning finished with a 5-5 record. In 1957, Baldwin and his team of Gord Haynes, Art Kleinmeyer and new lead Bill Price finished the round robin undefeated, giving Baldwin his second Brier. In 1958, Jack Geddes was inserted into the lineup to play third, replacing Haynes who was bumped back to second, who replaced the departing Kleinmayer. The team finished the round robin with an 8-2 record, and had to defeat Terry Braunstein's Manitoba rink to claim the title. Baldwin did not return to the Brier until 1971, where his team of Tom Kroeger, Rich Cust and Reg Van Wassenhove finished with a record of 5-5.

"Douglas Elliot (18 April 1923 - 12 March 2005) also known as W.I.D. Elliot and Doug(i.e.) Elliot is a former Scottish international rugby union player, who played for Scotland. He was capped 29 times for Scotland between 1947-54. He was never dropped, but did spend at least six matches away due to injuries including the whole 1953 seasons. He was six feet three inches and over fourteen stone. He was a backrow forward, and has also been inducted to the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame. He was one of the few Scottish players to escape untarnished by the 44-0 defeat by South Africa during the period. Elliot was the only Scot to be named by the South African rugby correspondent R.K. Stent amongst the best players who had faced the 1951-2 Springbok tour to the British Isles. Allan Massie talking of the 1950s, said: \""Elliot was my first Rugby hero, and for a long time in the Fifties, he was the only one a Scots boy could have... the Scottish sides he played in, especially in the Fifties, gave him little chance to display his attacking abilities. All the same, match reports of the time make frequent mention of Elliot bursting from the line-out to run thirty yards... He was undoubtedly the nearest thing to a forward in the classic All Black mould that Scotland produced in the twenty years after the war, for he was fast also, possessed all the basic skills, and breathed aggression. It was fitting that almost his last game for Scotland was against the All Blacks in 1954, when he captained the side that held the tourists to a single penalty goal.\"" Bill McLaren remembers in 1947 going for a Scotland trial, and playing at the back of the line-out, \""the only time the ball was thrown anywhere near there and I got it I found myself enmeshed in a vice-like grip. The feeling was of two iron bands imprisoning my arms. The bands belonging to Douglas Elliot, one of the greatest Scottish wing-forwards, whose strength had been developed in his every-day life as a son of the soil. I was much impressed by the form of temporary paralysis he imposed on my arms and it did not surprise me that he remained Scotland's most capped wing-forward with 29 appearances until John Jeffrey gained his 30th cap in the second Test against the All Blacks in Auckland in June 1990.\""",Agent,Athlete,RugbyPlayer

"Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246 (1952), is a U.S. Supreme Court case, relevant to the legal topic of criminal intent. It described two classes of crimes, those requiring a mental state, and those that do not. It did not did not delineate a precise line between them. In one class are traditional crimes, some of which have been around since before laws existed, such as stealing. This first class of crimes required a jury to find both an act, a harm, and an intent to act against the law. The second class, public welfare offenses, did not require a criminal mental state such as intent of knowledge. These included regulatory laws necessary for the public health and welfare, such as relating to food and drug safety. The purpose was to create a public awareness of both acts and negligent failure to act, which creates a public danger, even if there is no actual injury to a person or property. Morissette was a recycler who collected spent bomb casings from an air force practice bombing range, thinking they were abandoned, then sold them as scrap metal for $84.00. He was charged and convicted of \""knowingly\"" converting government property to himself or the junk dealer. He defended that he honestly believed the casings were abandoned, and appealed. The Supreme Court reversed the conviction on the basis that \""an injury can amount to a crime only when inflicted by intention\"", that the person must intend to commit a crime. The court wrote that it is \""universal... in mature systems of law\"", that if there is to be punishment for a harmful act, there must be \""some mental element\"". Crime is a \""compound concept, generally constituted only from the concurrence of an evil-meaning mind with an evil-acting hand... As the states codified the common laws of crimes [wrote specific criminal laws], even if enactments were silent on the subject\"" of intention, and omitted to include it in the code, the state courts assumed the omission did not mean the legislature meant to exclude the requirement that a jury find criminal intent. Rather, it was evidence that \""intent was so inherent\"" in the meaning of the concept of was constitutes a \""crime\"", that it did not need to be mentioned in the statute. At the same time, the Morissette opinion acknowledges that the category of criminal legislation encompassing the statute in question must be distinguished from a different category of criminal statutes applicable to public welfare offenses. The Court notes that public welfare offenses, unlike common law crimes, do not intrinsically involve harm to the State, persons, property, or public morals, but are typified only by \""neglect where the law requires care, or inaction where it imposes a duty.\"" Public welfare offenses — examples of which include public health laws, building codes, or food and drug safety laws — do not require a mental state or awareness on the part of the defendant.",UnitOfWork,LegalCase,SupremeCourtOfTheUnitedStatesCase

"Jiang Qing (Chinese: 江青; Wade–Giles: Chiang Ch'ing, also known as Madame Mao; March 19, 1914 – May 14, 1991) was a Chinese actress and a major political figure during the Cultural Revolution (1966–76). She was the fourth wife of Mao Zedong, the Chairman of the Communist Party and Paramount leader of China. She used the stage name Lan Ping (蓝苹) during her acting career, and was known by many other names. She married Mao in Yan'an in November 1938 and served as the inaugural \""First Lady\"" of the People's Republic of China. Jiang Qing was best known for playing a major role in the Cultural Revolution and for forming the radical political alliance known as the \""Gang of Four\"". Jiang Qing served as Mao's personal secretary in the 1940s and was head of the Film Section of the Communist Party's Propaganda Department in the 1950s. She served as an important emissary for Mao in the early stages of the Cultural Revolution. In 1966 she was appointed deputy director of the Central Cultural Revolution Group. She collaborated with Lin Biao to advance Mao's unique brand of Communist ideology as well as Mao's cult of personality. At the height of the Cultural Revolution, Jiang Qing held significant influence in the affairs of state, particularly in the realm of culture and the arts, and was idolized in propaganda posters as the \""Great Flagbearer of the Proletarian Revolution\"". In 1969, Jiang gained a seat on the Politburo. Before Mao's death, the Gang of Four controlled many of China's political institutions, including the media and propaganda. However, Jiang Qing, deriving most of her political legitimacy from Mao, often found herself at odds with other top leaders. Mao's death in 1976 dealt a significant blow to Jiang Qing's political fortunes. She was arrested in October 1976 by Hua Guofeng and his allies, and was subsequently condemned by party authorities. Since then, Jiang Qing has been officially branded as having been part of the \""Lin Biao and Jiang Qing Counter-Revolutionary Clique\"" (林彪江青反革命集团), to which most of the blame for the damage and devastation caused by the Cultural Revolution was assigned. Though she was initially sentenced to death, her sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1983.

"WWRU is a Korean language AM radio station licensed to Jersey City, New Jersey, broadcasting to the New York metropolitan area on 1660 kHz AM. The station's studios are located in Manhattan. AM 1660 launched on December 8, 1995 as WJDM, shortly after the Federal Communications Commission in the United States expanded the AM band to include new stations in the range of 1610 to 1700 khz. It was the first such expanded band AM station in the U.S. and within two months of sign-on became the New York Radio AAHS children's network owned & operated affiliate on February 2, 1996. Until other stations were licensed on the frequency and adjacent channels in other parts of the country in subsequent years, WJDM could be heard at night throughout the eastern U.S. and Canada. When AAHS' parent company, Children's Broadcasting Corporation, discontinued the format in January 1998, the ten CBC-owned stations, including WJDM, began airing Beat Radio, a club dance music format, every night between 7pm and 7am while a random mix of music was broadcast during the day.

"6469 Armstrong, provisional designation 1982 PC, is a stony Flora asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 3 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Czech astronomer Antonín Mrkos at Kleť Observatory on 14 August 1982. The S-type asteroid is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.8–2.7 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,208 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.20 and an inclination of 4° with respect to the ecliptic. The first used precovery was taken at Crimea-Nauchnij in 1972, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 10 years prior to its discovery. Two rotational light-curves of this asteroid were obtained from photometric observations made at the Palomar Transient Factory, California, in January and February 2014. The light-curves gave a concurring rotation period of 6.040±0.040 and 5.9648±0.1423 hours with a brightness variation of 0.65 and 0.70 in magnitude, respectively (U=2/2). According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's space-based Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 3.7 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.24, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an identical albedo of 0.24 – derived from 8 Flora, the largest member and namesake of its orbital family – and calculates a diameter of 2.9 kilometers, based on a weaker absolute magnitude of 14.87. The minor planet was named after U.S. astronaut Neil Armstrong (1930–2012), on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission. On 20 July 1969, Armstrong was one of the first two humans to land on the Moon, and the first person to walk on it, shortly followed by Buzz Aldrin, after whom the asteroid 6470 Aldrin is named. The minor planet 6471 Collins is named after the third crew member of the Apollo 11 mission. In 1966, Armstrong also conducted the first docking in space together with David Scott aboard Gemini 8.

"HD 6434 b is an extrasolar planet orbiting the star HD 6434. It has a minimum mass about half that of Jupiter. It orbits the star very close, over 2.5 times as close as Mercury orbits the Sun. For this reason it completes one orbit in only 22 days. Unlike true \""hot Jupiters\"" like 51 Pegasi b, HD 6434 b does not have a circular orbit, but rather an eccentric one. By studying observations taken by the Hipparcos astrometric mission, a group of scientists proposed that the planet has an inclination of 179.9° (almost exactly face-on) and a mass of 196 Jupiters. If that was the case, the planet would be a red dwarf instead. However, the data was anything but conclusive, and statistically it is extremely unlikely to lie in such a position. But because the inclination is unknown, so is the true mass of the planet. Still, it is very probable that the object is a true planet.",Place,CelestialBody,Planet
"The Abraham Path is a long-distance walking trail across the Middle East which connects the sites visited by the patriarch Abraham as recorded in ancient religious texts and traditions. The path begins in the north in Yuvacalı, Turkey, which is a village located north of the city of Urfa (natively: Şanlıurfa), and goes as far south as Beersheba in the Negev desert of Israel. Local partnership organizations and tour operators in the Middle East facilitate the travel of walkers on the path and there is now information available for the independent traveler, including maps, GPS tracks, and site descriptions. The Abraham Path currently extends across 1078 kilometers (about 670 miles) through four countries and the eventual path will traverse 5,000 kilometers (about 3,000 miles) through ten countries. People walk the trail, staying in homestays and sharing meals with local families in villages along the way. The trail passes through sites of Abrahamic history, varied landscapes, and a myriad of communities of different faiths and cultures, which reflect the rich diversity of the Middle East: from Kurdish, Muslim, Jewish, Christian, Alevi, Bedouin, Fellahin, Samaritan, etc. The story of Abraham is about a man from the Bronze Age who travels throughout the Fertile Crescent and into the desert of the Arabian peninsula.",Place,RouteOfTransportation,Road

It breeds in Arctic and some northern temperate regions, but winters somewhat farther south in temperate zones, when it can form large flocks on coastal waters. It can fly at speeds up to 113 km/h (70 mph). The eider's nest is built close to the sea and is lined with eiderdown, plucked from the female's breast. This soft and warm lining has long been harvested for filling pillows and quilts, but in more recent years has been largely replaced by down from domestic farm-geese and synthetic alternatives.

Between 1840 and 1846 Thompson worked in Philadelphia and in 1843 refined Daniel Davis Jr.'s electroplating method for colouring daguerreotypes by using a gum tragacanth resist. With this technique colours could be built up in the manner of some types of printmaking. According to an article in the 1892 American Journal of Photography by editor Julius Sachse, Thompson traveled to Paris in 1845 from New York without speaking any French and with an introduction from the Russian Consul in New York to the Russian Vice-Consul in Paris who in turn arranged an introduction to Russian photographer Sergei Lvovich Levitsky. Levitsky is quoted by Sachse as declaring Thompson's daguerreotypes were 'works of art'. Sachse further claims that Thompson influenced for the development of portrait daguerreotypes in Paris. From 1849-50 Thompson was listed as a photographer at 14 boulevard Poissonnière, rue Basse-du-Rempart in 1851, then 22 rue de Choiseul from 1853-59. Levitsky returned to Russia by 1849 but came back to Paris by 1859 where he took over Thompson's Choiseul address. This was also the premises for the French arts club. Thompson (aka as surname 'Warren-Thompson'} produced daguerreotypes in Paris as well as very fine stereo daguerreotypes and a number of theatrical self-portraits some of very large size, but his body of known work is scant.

"Mysmenopsis is a kleptoparasitic genus of tiny tropical and subtropical American spiders in the family Mysmenidae. Most live in the funnelwebs of spiders in the family Dipluridae. M. archeri lives on webs of a species in the family Pholcidae, M. capae and M. cienga have been observed living in Cyrtophora (Araneidae) webs. One reason why diplurid webs are preferred seems to be that they are persistent in time and space, sometimes spanning several years. The monotypic genus Isela is closely related. Mysmenopsis furtiva from Jamaica lives as a kleptoparasite and commensal in webs of Ischnothele xera. It steals portions of its host's prey, but also consumes minute trapped insects that are not sought after by the host. In order not to be recognized, it moves only slowly when the host does not move; else it synchronizes its rapid movements with the movements of the host. M. furtiva has been observed to feed on one end of a prey animal, while the host feeds on the other. When feeding, its legs and pedipalps remain motionless, but its abdomen sways slowly and slightly. One feeding bout can double its abdominal volume. The host shows anti-kleptoparasite behavior, amongst others by adding silk between the kleptoparasite and the feeding site.

A total of 42 athletes from 13 nations competed in the 100 m event. The first round of the competition saw several false starts and disqualifications, partly due to the athletes lack of familiarity with the local starter's orders, which were called in Greek. After the first round this issue was rectified. There was no individual timing for each runner and only the winners of each race had their times recorded. Other athletes were ranked visually and in some instances the remaining distance between an athlete and the one behind him was documented. Four of the six finalists were Americans and two of them took first and second place – Archie Hahn and Fay Moulton. Australia's Nigel Barker came third. Hahn's win built upon his victory from the 1904 Olympic Games. He is sometimes credited with being the first man to retain the Olympic 100 m, but this is disputed as the Intercalated Games have not received official recognition as part of the Olympic series from the International Olympic Committee.

"Adama ɓii Ardo Hassana (c. 1771 – c. 1848), more commonly known as Modibo Adama, was a Fulani scholar and holy warrior, who hailed from the Ba'en clan of Fulbe. He led a jihad into the region of Fumbina (in modern-day Cameroon and Nigeria), opening the region for Fulani colonisation. As a result of Adama's constant warring, the Fulani today make up the largest ethnic group in Northern Cameroon (at more than 60% of the region's entire population, which considering the fact that they weren't from the area, is a remarkable feat), and Islam is the dominant religion. The wars also forced many peoples south into the forest region. Adama studied in Hausaland and earned the title \""Modibo\"" (\""Lettered One\"") for his scholarship. Upon finishing his studies, he returned home to Gurin and learned of the jihad declared by Fulani mystic Usman dan Fodio. When he accompanied a delegation to visit Usman, the leader ordered Adama to extend his jihad east as \""Lamido Fumbina\"" (Ruler of the Southlands). Adama raised an army and attacked Bata settlements near Gurin. He took the villages, and many more traditional Fulbe leaders and new soldiers came to his side. He next took on Mandara, the largest and best organised state in the region. He swept over several smaller settlements and eventually conquered the Mandara capital, Dulo, with ease. While his men celebrated, however, the Mandara army counterattacked and recaptured the town. Though he fought many more campaigns, Adama now spent most of his time in Yola, which became his capital. He set about creating the administrative structure of his new state, which he named Adamawa after himself. Adama ruled the empire, subordinate only to Usman dan Fodio in Sokoto. Below him lay the heads of major settlements, known as lamibe (singular: lamido). The village formed the smallest unit of government. Upon Adama's death in 1847, his son Muhammadu Lawal became Lamido of Adamawa. The empire was not to last, however, as colonial battles and division eventually destroyed the independent Fulani state. The conquest had long-term repercussions, however. The Fulani became the dominant ethnic group in the region, and Islam the major religion. The herdsmen altered the land to be more suitable for herding cattle, their primary pursuit. The jihad also pushed those peoples who had lived on the Adamawa Plateau south into the forest, the single most important event in the populating of Southern Cameroon.",Agent,Person,Monarch

"Osvaldo Álvarez Guerrero (1940 – 27 July 2008) was an Argentine Radical Civic Union (UCR) politician. He served as Governor of Río Negro Province and as a National Deputy. Born in Florida (a suburb of Buenos Aires, Álvarez Guerrero joined the Radical Civic Union of the People (UCRP, the more conservative faction led by Ricardo Balbín) in 1958 in his home town of Vicente López, a neighboring community. He became a lawyer and relocated to Viedma, in Río Negro Province, in 1964. UCR Governor Carlos Nielsen appointed him subsecretary of social affairs, serving in that post until the military coup of 28 June 1966 which toppled President Arturo Illia. That year he moved to San Carlos de Bariloche, where he practiced as a lawyer, taught philosophy and wrote for newspapers including La Nación and Diario Río Negro. He later wrote several books, particularly on political history. Upon the return of democracy, Álvarez Guerrero helped relaunch the UCR in Río Negro and was a leading player in the national internal Radical movement of Raúl Alfonsín and Conrado Storani. In 1973 he became President of the provincial committee of the UCR and was elected to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies. Following the coup of 1976, he was arrested and 'disappeared' for 72 hours, being released following protests by his party, including former President Illia, although he lost his passport and the right to leave the country. In October 1983, following the return of democracy, Álvarez Guerrero was elected governor of Río Negro with 63% of the vote. He was a staunch federalist and a prime mover behind attempts to move the Argentine federal capital to Viedma. He was returned to the Chamber of Deputies in 1987. Álvarez Guerrero was elected first vice-president of the National Committee of the UCR in 1989, and in 1991 he became President of the National Convention. He became a vocal critic of the 1993 Olivos Pact between UCR leader Raúl Alfonsín and President Carlos Menem (of the opposititon Justicialist Party), and opposed the subsequent 1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution, resigning in 1994 over the nomination of his successor as governor, Horacio Massaccesi, as UCR candidate for president.

He is remembered as a key figure in the Hiberno-Scottish mission, or Irish missionary activity in early medieval Europe. In recent years, however, as Columbanus's deeds and legacy have come to be re-examined by historians, the traditional narrative of his career has been challenged and doubts have been raised regarding his actual involvement in missionary work and the extent to which he was driven by purely religious motives or also by a concern for playing an active part in politics and church politics in Francia.

Formed in the 1920s by the construction of an arch dam just above the river's mouth, the lake is approximately 7.5 miles (12 km) long and averages 0.6 miles (1 km) wide at full extent. Lake Shannon is part of a cascade of two reservoirs, the Baker River Hydroelectric Project, built on the lower half of the Baker River by Puget Sound Energy for generating hydroelectricity. The reservoir is located just outside the western boundary of North Cascades National Park and just north of Concrete. Historically Lake Shannon did not exist and Baker Lake was smaller, and the Baker River area was used primarily for fur trapping, logging, and concrete making. The formation of the lake led to problems with migrating salmon in the Baker River, which would often exceed 20,000 annually. A fish passage system was begun in the 1950s and completed in 1959 after the construction of Upper Baker Dam, the uppermost Baker River reservoir.

"The piebald madtom (Noturus gladiator) is a species of madtom catfish that is found in seven river systems in the Tennessee and Mississippi coastal tributaries. The most common systems N. gladiator is found in are, the Hatchie River, Obion River, and Wolf River. This species is very susceptible to environmental changes including flow regimes, siltation in nesting sites, and poor environmental quality. The Noturus catfish reproduces from February to September and females reach sexual maturity in only one year. Current management strategies for this recently discovered species haven’t been completely developed yet, but could be comparative to the management of other madtom species. Siltation in the southern portions of the rivers, inhabited by Noturus gladiator that comes from the northern aspects of the waterways is causing stress on the reproductive success due to nest suffocation. There are records as close as twenty years ago showing the species inhabiting multiple other rivers around the areas it currently inhabits. This could be a sign that the species is in a decline. There should be population surveys done on the existing habitat and water quality surveys done in the inhabited areas as well as the uninhabited neighboring areas to see what the limiting pollutant might be in the water causing habitats to shrink.

"The Socialist Party of Latvia (Latvian: Latvijas Sociālistiskā partija, LSP, Russian: Социалистическая партия Латвии) was formed in 1994 as a successor party to the Communist Party of Latvia, which was banned in 1991. In essence, the party is communist; according to the programme of the party, the LSP was founded as an organization upholding socialist ideas after the 1991 events that the party describes as a 'counter-revolutionary bourgeois-nationalist coup'. The current acting president of the party is Vladimirs Frolovs. Between 1999 and 2015, the position was held by Alfrēds Rubiks, once mayor of Riga and later leader of the unionist movement and head of the Latvian Communist Party (CPSU platform). He was imprisoned for six years in 1991 on charges of participating in a coup d'état against the Latvian authorities in August 1991. He is not one of the party's members in the Saeima (Latvian Parliament) since he is not allowed to contest elections. However, his sons Artūrs Rubiks and Raimonds Rubiks are members of the Saeima representing the Socialist Party, elected on a joint list with Harmony. The LSP is more popular among the Russian-speaking population of Latvia. It places a high priority on issues important to ethnic Russians, such as language and citizenship laws. The party also believes that Latvian citizenship should be granted to all citizens of USSR living in Latvia in 1990. This would entail a major change in the current law which only gives automatic citizenship to descendants of people who were citizens of the Republic of Latvia before it was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940 and requires the Soviet citizens who moved to Latvia between 1940 and 1990 (mainly Russians) to go through a naturalization process. In the election held on 5 October 2002, the party was part of the For Human Rights in United Latvia (Latvian: Par cilvēka tiesībām vienotā Latvijā) coalition that won 19.0% of the popular vote and 25 out of 100 seats, 5 of those seats went to Socialist Party. The party was a member of this alliance of predominantly Russian-speaking parties from 1998 to 2003.

"Corbicula fluminea is a species of freshwater clam, an aquatic bivalve mollusk in the family Cyrenidae. This species is often confused with Corbicula fluminalis due to the two species' similar colour and texture. The species is regarded as having originated somewhere in Eastern Asia, leading to the common names of Asian clam or Asiatic clam. In the aquarium and koi pond trade, it is often called golden clam or golden freshwater clam. In Southeast Asia, it is known as the prosperity clam or good luck clam. The species has been introduced into many parts of the world, including South America, North America and Europe. Right after reaching maturity, these clams produce eggs, followed by sperm. Even later, they produce eggs and sperm simultaneously. They can self-fertilize, and release up to 2,000 juveniles per day, and more than 100,000 in a lifetime. Juveniles are only 1 mm long when discharged, and take one to four years to reach maturity. At this time, they are about 1 cm long. Adults can reach a length of about 5 cm. The outside of the shell is normally yellow-green with concentric rings. The color can flake, leaving white spots. The shells are lightly purple on the inside. They feed primarily on phytoplankton (algae), which they filter from the sandy or muddy bottoms of streams, lakes, or canals. According to the United States Geological Survey, C. fluminea is likely to continue to expand its North American range until it reaches its lower temperature tolerance. The primary economic and social impact of the invasion of C. fluminea has been billions of dollars in costs associated with clogged water intake pipes of power plants, among others. Ecologically, C. fluminea contributes to declines and replacement of highly vulnerable, already threatened native clams. .",Species,Animal,Mollusca

She was a German aristocrat, who became a hermit on the frontier of Prussia and is honored as the patron saint of that region. She imitated the life of St. Elizabeth of Hungary, who was the Duchess of Thuringia during her youth, and has also been canonized a saint. She was married at the age of fifteen to a nobleman and bore children by him. She convinced her husband of, and raised her children in a contemplative and mystical form of Christianity. He died while they were on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and Jutta became a single mother. Each child eventually entered a monastery upon reaching a suitable age, and this left Jutta able to pursue a more austere religious way of life. Like her model, St. Elizabeth, Jutta became a member of the Third Order of St. Francis. She gave away or sold her property and lived the rest of her life in contemplation and in caring for the poor and the sick. She became a figure of ridicule among her neighbors as she carried out her service to the poor of the region. In her last years, Jutta moved to the frontier of Christian Europe. She chose as her base a derelict building in Bildschön (now Bielczyny), near Kulmsee in Prussia, part of the Monastic State of the Teutonic Order, the area governed by the Teutonic Knights, whose Grand Master, Anno von Sangershausen, was a relative of hers. There the knights sheltered her. Visitors came to her to receive counsel and prayers, and she quickly established a reputation as a saint. She said that there were three things that can bring one near to God: painful sickness, exile from home, and poverty voluntarily accepted for God. She dedicated her final days to praying for the non-Christian population of the region. She died around 1260. In keeping with her wishes, Archbishop Friar Heidenreich of Kulm, O.P., earlier Archbishop of Armagh, Ireland, and now first Bishop of Kulm, had her buried at the cathedral.

"Sebastes schlegelii also known as the Korean rockfish, is a predatory species of seaperch found in northern Asia. The species is a popular quarry for anglers. S. schlegelii are blackish with black pelvic, anal and caudal fins. The seaperch has a total of 8 weak head spines. It is black when young and turns a mottled gray on the sides with age, often nearing white. This species can vary greatly in size between bodies of water. They can live for up to 18 years, and older individuals are often much larger than average; the maximum recorded length is 60 cm (24 in). The record is 6.6 lb (3 kg). It is a pelagic fish, occurring on the continental shelf. Like other pelagic fish, they spend most of their time amid the water columns and are generally associated with rougher terra. This can make it somewhat inconvenient for commercial fisheries, which are often situated in nearshore, shallow water, and rocky areas (reefs). They make up an important component of nearshore fisheries in northern Asia. S. schlegelii breed via internal fertilization, females storing sperm until the development of the eggs. The phases between the start of the process and the end are separated by several months. The majority of the young are reared in late winter to early spring. Females produce between 125,000 and 1,200,000 eggs every breeding season. However it has been noted that not all of the eggs are released every year. It has been occasionally observed that the female may absorb the eggs back into her system.",Species,Animal,Fish

"Joseph Benjamin Shaute (August 1, 1899 in Peckville, Pennsylvania – February 21, 1970 in Scranton, Pennsylvania) was a pitcher in Major League Baseball. He pitched from 1922 to 1934, and during his 13-year career, he played primarily for the Cleveland Indians. He attended Juniata College and Mansfield University of Pennsylvania. He made his major league debut in September 1922, and threw his first pitch to legendary swatter Babe Ruth. Baseball historian William C. Kashatus noted that when Shaute came to the pitching mound, \""the Indians were clinging to a one-run lead in the bottom of the eighth with two outs and bases loaded with Yankees\"". Shaute gained notoriety when he struck out Ruth on four pitches to end the inning. In the following inning, he faced another powerful hitter, Bob Meusel, who \""swung so hard on Shaute's first offering that he whirled completely around and fell to the ground\"". The pitcher next struck out Yankee catcher Freddie Hoffman. Kashatus observed that Shaute \""continued to dominate Ruth for the next three years\"". The situation changed in 1927, however, when Ruth hit 60 home runs, setting a major league record that stood for more than seven decades. Ruth hit three of those home runs—numbers 30, 40, and 52—off of Shaute. Nevertheless, during his 13-season career, Shaute struck out Ruth on more than 30 occasions. Shaute enjoyed his best season in 1924, \""when he won 20 games for the lowly Indians who finished sixth that year\"".",Agent,Athlete,BaseballPlayer

"Edmund the Martyr (also known as St Edmund or Edmund of East Anglia, died 20 November 869) was king of East Anglia from about 855 until his death. Almost nothing is known about Edmund. He is thought to have been of East Anglian origin and was first mentioned in an annal of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, written some years after his death. The kingdom of East Anglia was devastated by the Vikings, who destroyed any contemporary evidence of his reign. Later writers produced fictitious accounts of his life, asserting that he was born in 841, the son of Æthelweard, an obscure East Anglian king, whom it was said Edmund succeeded when he was fourteen (or alternatively that he was the youngest son of a Germanic king named 'Alcmund'). Later versions of Edmund's life relate that he was crowned on 25 December 855 at Burna (probably Bures St. Mary in Suffolk), which at that time functioned as the royal capital, and that he became a model king. In 869, the Great Heathen Army advanced on East Anglia and killed Edmund. He may have been slain by the Danes in battle, but by tradition he met his death at an unidentified place known as Haegelisdun, after he refused the Danes' demand that he renounce Christ: the Danes beat him, shot him with arrows and then beheaded him, on the orders of Ivar the Boneless and his brother Ubba. According to one legend, his head was then thrown into the forest, but was found safe by searchers after following the cries of a wolf that was calling, \""Hic, Hic, Hic\"" – \""Here, Here, Here\"". Commentators have noted how Edmund's death bears resemblance to the fate suffered by St Sebastian, St Denis and St Mary of Egypt. A coinage commemorating Edmund was minted from around the time East Anglia was absorbed by the kingdom of Wessex and a popular cult emerged. In about 986, Abbo of Fleury wrote of his life and martyrdom. The saint's remains were temporarily moved from Bury St Edmunds to London for safekeeping in 1010. His shrine at Bury was visited by many kings, including Canute, who was responsible for rebuilding the abbey: the stone church was rebuilt again in 1095. During the Middle Ages, when Edmund was regarded as the patron saint of England, Bury and its magnificent abbey grew wealthy, but during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, his shrine was destroyed. The mediaeval manuscripts and other works of art relating to Edmund that have survived include Abbo's Passio Sancti Eadmundi, John Lydgate's 14th-century Life, the Wilton Diptych and a number of church wall paintings.",Agent,Person,Monarch

"Saint Giovanni Leonardi (1541 – 9 October 1609) was an Italian Roman Catholic priest and the founder of the Clerks Regular of the Mother of God of Lucca. He was born in the Republic of Lucca and was ordained as a priest in 1572. He first dedicated himself to the Christian formation of adolescents in his local Lucca parish. He assumed the name of \""Giovanni of the Mother of God\"" as his religious name. In 1574 he founded a group charged to deepen Christian faith and devotion; this foundation occurred as part of the movement known as the Counter-Reformation. Leonardi worked with this group to spread devotion to the Blessed Mother and devotion to the Forty Hours as well as spreading the message of the importance of frequent reception of the Eucharist. This foundation received approval from Pope Paul V in 1614. Leonardi took his work to Rome where he became friends with Saint Philip Neri. Neri held him in high regard for his qualities of firmness and judgment and entrusted him to delicate works such as the reform of the Benedictine congregation of Montevergine. He then founded with J. Vivès the seminary of the Propagation of the Faith. He died in 1609 dedicating himself to his brothers suffering from the influenza epidemic that was raging in Rome at the time. The final Rule of his institute was published in 1851. Two houses of the Clerks of the Mother of God were opened when he died and three others were opened during the seventeenth century.

"15268 Wendelinefroger, provisional designation 1990 WF3, is a stony, spheroidal, and binary asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 3.4 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Belgian astronomer Eric Elst at ESO's La Silla Observatory in northern Chile, on 18 November 1990. The S-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.8–2.9 AU once every 3 years and 8 months (1,329 days). Its orbit is tilted by 3 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic and shows a relatively high eccentricity of 0.24. A light-curve analysis at the Leura Observatory in Australia rendered a rotation period of 2.4 hours with a low brightness amplitude of 0.07 in magnitude, which indicates that the asteroid is of nearly spheroidal shape. It has an albedo of 0.20, as assumed by the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL), which is a typical value for bodies with a stony surface composition. In 2008, a minor-planet moon was discovered orbiting Wendelinefroger at a distance of 8.7 kilometers and with an orbital period of 25.07±0.02 hours. Based on mutual occultations of Wendelinefroger and its moon, the diameter ratio for the two bodies is at least 0.24 (i.e. secondary-to-primary mean-diameter ratio), which would render an estimated diameter of 0.8 kilometer or more for the asteroid's moon, using CALL's calculated diameter of 3.4 kilometer for the primary body. The minor planet is named in honour of Belgian female singer Wendeline Froger (b. 1948), who has a soprano voice and performs at church celebrations, weddings and for selected audiences at her residence. She has a preference to sing Lieder by Robert Schumann, after whom the minor planet 4003 Schumann is named.",Place,CelestialBody,Planet

His father owned an ice cream parlor, where Mammes worked as a youth. Taking place during the depression, many thought the 1932 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles, was going to be an economic failure. Even so, after a few film stars such as Charlie Chaplin, Marlene Dietrich, Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford volunteered to entertain, 37 countries sent over 1300 athletes to the games.

"(For the Catholic martyr, see Thomas Pilchard.) Major-General Thomas David Pilcher, CB (8 July 1858 – 14 December 1928) was a British Army officer, who commanded a mounted infantry unit in the Second Boer War and the 17th (Northern) Division during the First World War, before being removed from command in disgrace during the Battle of the Somme. Pilcher spent his early career as an infantry officer, first seeing active service on colonial campaigns in Nigeria in the late 1890s followed by field command in the Second Boer War (1899–1902), on which he published a book of lessons learned in 1903. Following the war, he held a number of senior commands in India. However, further promotion was checked by his having come into conflict with his commander-in-chief, who regarded him as unsuited for senior command in part because of his writings; Pilcher was a keen student of the German army and its operational methods, and an active theorist who published a number of controversial books advocating the adoption of new military techniques as well as an anonymous invasion novel. On the outbreak of the First World War he was on leave in England, and eventually obtained the command of 17th (Northern) Division, a New Army volunteer unit. The division supported the initial attacks at the Battle of the Somme in July 1916, where Pilcher again clashed with his superiors over his refusal to push on an attack without pausing for preparations, believing it would result in failure and heavy casualties. After ten days of fighting, Pilcher was sacked and sent to command a reserve centre in England. From here, he wrote a series of books before retiring in 1919. He ran as a parliamentary candidate for the splinter right-wing National Party in the 1918 general election, and continued a loose involvement with right-wing politics which extended to membership in the early British Fascisti. Pilcher had married Kathleen Gonne, daughter of a cavalry officer, in 1889; the marriage was strained, partly through Pilcher's gambling habits and adultery, and partly through his dislike for Maud Gonne, Kathleen's sister and a prominent Irish nationalist. The couple divorced in 1911, having had four children; one would later become a High Court judge, while another died on the Western Front in 1915.

"The Tata Memorial Hospital is situated in Parel, Mumbai in India. It is a specialist cancer treatment and research centre, closely associated with the Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer (ACTREC). One of the fields of specialization of this hospital is in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (A.L.L). The hospital claims to treat and cure 99% of the A.L.L patients. This hospital is also one of the few in India to have a P.E.T. scanner. The Director of this hospital is Dr. Rajendra A Badwe, who took over from for director Dr. K.A. Dinshaw. The Tata Memorial Centre is the national comprehensive cancer centre for the prevention, treatment, education and research in Cancer and is recognized as one of the leading cancer centres in this part of the world. This achievement has been possible due to the far-sighted and total support of the Department of Atomic Energy, under Dr. Homi N Sethna responsible for managing this Institution since 1962. The Tata Memorial Hospital was initially commissioned by the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust on 28 February 1941 as a center with enduring value and a mission for concern for the Indian people. In 1952 the Indian Cancer Research Centre was established as a pioneer research institute for basic research—later called the Cancer Research Institute (CRI). In 1957 the Ministry of Health took over the Tata Memorial Hospital. The transfer of the administrative control of the Tata Memorial Centre (Tata Memorial Hospital & Cancer Research Institute) to the Department of Atomic Energy in 1962 was the next major milestone. The Tata Memorial Hospital and Cancer Research Institute merged as the two arms of the Tata Memorial Centre (TMC) in 1966 as a classic example of private philanthropy augmented by Government support with a mandate for Service, Education & Research in Cancer.",Place,Building,Hospital

Yan's charismatic personality on his television show can be attributed to his spontaneous humour that included one-liners spoken with his trademark Cantonese accent or him playing with his food or cookware.

"Saint Leander of Seville (Spanish: San Leandro de Sevilla) (Cartagena, c. 534–Seville, 13 March 600 or 601), brother of the encyclopedist St. Isidore of Seville, was the Catholic Bishop of Seville who was instrumental in effecting the conversion to Catholicism of the Visigothic kings Hermengild and Reccared of Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula, comprising both modern Spain and Portugal). Leander and Isidore and their siblings (all sainted) belonged to an elite family of Hispano-Roman stock of Carthago Nova. Their father Severianus is claimed to be according to their hagiographers a dux or governor of Cartagena, though this seems more of a fanciful interpretation since Isidore simply states that he was a citizen. The family moved to Seville around 554. The children's subsequent public careers reflect their distinguished origin: Leander and Isidore both became bishops of Seville, and their sister Saint Florentina was an abbess who directed forty convents and one thousand nuns. Even the third brother, Fulgentius, appointed Bishop of Écija at the first triumph of Catholicism over Arianism, but of whom little is known, has been canonised as a saint. The family as a matter of course were staunch Catholics, as were the great majority of the Romanized population, from top to bottom; only the Visigothic nobles and the kings were Arians. It should be stated that there was less Visigothic persecution of Catholics than legend and hagiography have painted. From a modern standpoint, the dangers of Catholic Christianity were more political. The Catholic hierarchy were in collusion with the representatives of the Byzantine emperor, who had maintained a considerable territory in the far south of Hispania ever since his predecessor had been invited to the peninsula by the former Visigothic king several decades before. In the north, Liuvigild struggled to maintain his possessions on the far side of the Pyrenees, where his Merovingian cousins and in-laws cast envious eyes on them and had demonstrated that they would stop at nothing with the murder of Liuvigild's sister.",Agent,Cleric,Saint

"Pierre-Célestin Rwigema (born 27 July 1953) is a Rwandan politician previously associated with the moderate faction of the Republican Democratic Movement (MDR) party. He was Prime Minister of Rwanda from 1995–2000 and Education Minister from 1994-1995. When he was sworn in as Prime Minister he pledged to reunite his then ethnically torn country. In 2001, he was accused of alleged involvement in the Rwandan Genocide and had an arrest warrant issued for him by the Rwandan government. These charges were brought against him after his resignation as Prime Minister, when he fled to the United States to seek political asylum. At the time of the accusation, he was studying towards a Master's degree in Business Administration at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, United States. The political climate in Rwanda was volatile at the time. The speaker of the house, Joseph Sabarenzi, resigned and fled. There was allegations of a royalist faction working to undermine the RPF government, and restore the Tutsi monarchy. It has been reported that these charges against him may have been politically motivated. According to Joseph Sebarenzi, a Tutsi and former speaker of the national assembly from 1997 to 2000, in his newly published memoir \""God Sleeps in Rwanda\"", he says that Rwigema was innocent. As quoted in Sebarenzi's memoir: \""Regularly I would hear from friends or on the radio that someone else in Rwanda was being targeted. There was Pierre Celestin Rwigema, the prime minister. He was forced to resign. While I was speaker, we had investigated him for mismanagement and embezzlement. The RPF wanted him out and hoped we would censure him. But our investigation could not prove that he had done anything wrong, so we cleared him. I knew that the RPF would not let that stand. So when I heard that Rwigema had resigned, I was not surprised. He eventually fled to the United States. The government of Rwanda told the U.S. government that he was involved in the genocide and asked that he be arrested. But an immigration judge cleared him\"". He was eventually proven innocent and granted political asylum by the United States immigration court in Detroit. In October 2011, Rwanda's prosecutor general, Martin Ngoga reported to the media that the judicial process in Rwanda also found no evidence indicting Rwigema in involvement with genocide and therefore his case was suspended. Mr Rwigema returned to Rwanda after 11 years in exile, stating that he was returning freely, and soon held a press conference where he revealed that his primary motivation to return home was to participate in the ongoing development of the country. In early May 2012, Mr Rwigema was one of 8 candidates elected by the Rwandan parliament among 18 candidates to represent Rwanda in the East African Legislative Assembly (EALA). He vowed to advocate for effective implementation of the EAC common market and customs union protocols, and the fast-tracking of the negotiations on monetary union and the realization of a political federation.",Agent,Politician,PrimeMinister

He was enthroned as a Pope of Alexandria on the second day of Pi Kogi Enavot, 863 A.M. (25 August 1147). During his papacy, the Copts were persecuted by the Muslim governors and Caliphs. Many were killed and sold as slaves. Several churches in Cairo, such as the church of Saint Menas in Saint Mary Church (Haret Elroum) and the church of El-Zohari, were plundered and destroyed. They were later rebuilt by the Coptic layman Abu El-Fakhr Salib Ibn Mikhail. It was also at this time (1164 AD) that Saint Bashnouna was killed by the Muslims. According to the History of the Patriarchs of Alexandria, the Emperor of Ethiopia wrote to John in 1152 for a new abuna or Metropolitan, because Abuna Mikael was too old; his request was denied. Although the name of the Emperor was not recorded, Carlo Conti Rossini identified him as Mara Takla Haymanot, arguing from this exchange that the true reason a new abuna was wanted was that Abuna Mikael refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the new Zagwe Dynasty. Pope John denied this request and was subsequently arrested and imprisoned for two weeks during the reign of the Fatimid caliph Al-Zafir.

Thrandina and its sister genus Galianora share the ancestral salticid traits of a tarsal claw on the female palpus and a median apophysis on the male palp. This is rare among neotropical salticids. Both genera are informally grouped as \""lapsiines\"", together with Lapsias. However, the shared basal characteristics with Lapsias could be symplesiomorphic. Males of Thrandina parocula are about 4 mm long. Their carapace is dark brown to black, except for a central pale longitudinal stripe on the thorax. The legs are pale to medium brown, with a darker femur I. The abdomen is medium brown with lighter chevrons above, and pale below with dark speckles. The female is slightly smaller with a bodylength of 3.6 mm. It looks like the male, but with more annulate legs.

"John Knowles Herr (born October 1, 1878 in the Whitehouse section of Readington Township, New Jersey – died March 12, 1955 in Washington, D.C.) was a career American soldier. Herr served for 40 years in the United States Cavalry and participated in the final battles of World War I as chief of staff of the 30th Division, but is best remembered for being the last Chief of U. S. Cavalry in history. In March 1938 Major General Herr was appointed Chief of Cavalry and became a fierce advocate of traditional horse cavalry troops. He defended cavalry as an independent branch of service and opposed conversion of mounted troops into mechanized or armored units. Herr's affection to horse, \""somewhat quixotic\"" for the period, temporarily made him \""a hero and a standard bearer\"" to generations of officers indoctrinated in cavalry tactics. German blitzkrieg in Poland and France compelled the military leadership in favor of armoured warfare, and the United States cavalry was mechanized contrary to Herr's objections. General Robert W. Grow wrote that \""had General Herr, from the beginning, taken a strong stand to mechanization of the Cavalry Branch, the Armored Force would have never been created\"" (as a separate combat arm). Instead, Herr \""lost it all\"": and his troops were gradually converted to armor. On March 9, 1942, War Department Circular No. 59 created the Army Ground Forces, Services of Supply, and Army Air Forces; and disbanded the offices of the combat arms chiefs, including Chief of Cavalry. Herr retired. He continued to speak in favor of the horse and co-authored The Story of the U.S. Cavalry (1953). Historians' assessment of Herr's four-year service as Chief of Cavalry range from \""stubborn obstructionist\"" (Hofmann), \""conservative and downright mossback\"" (Millett), \""diehard proponent of the horse\"" (Winton and Mets) to \""noble and tragic in his loyalty to horse ... and refusal to accept reality after Munich.\"" (Jarymowycz). and \""gallant and highly regarded officer ... proof that outdated beliefs would die hard\"" (D'Este).",Agent,Person,MilitaryPerson

A fierce opponent, Tzachas constructed the first Turkish navy and captured a few Aegean islands, supplemented by the conquest of Smyrna and Abydos. In the aftermath of the First Crusade Alexios I launched a counter-attack which regained the territories lost.

"Nestorius (/ˌnɛsˈtɔːriəs/; in Greek: Νεστόριος; c. 386 – 450) was Archbishop of Constantinople (now Istanbul) from 10 April 428 to August 431, when Emperor Theodosius II confirmed his condemnation by the Council of Ephesus on 22 June. His teachings included a rejection of the long-used title of Theotokos, \""Mother of God\"", for Mary, mother of Jesus, and they were considered by many to imply that he did not believe that Christ was truly God. That brought him into conflict with other prominent churchmen of the time, most notably Cyril of Alexandria, whom he accused of heresy. Nestorius sought to defend himself at the First Council of Ephesus in 431 but instead found himself formally condemned for heresy by a majority of the bishops and was subsequently removed from his see. On his own request, he retired to his former monastery, in or near Antioch. In 435, Theodosius II sent him into exile in Upper Egypt, where he lived on until 450, strenuously defending his orthodoxy. His last major defender within the Roman Empire, Theodoret of Cyrrhus, finally agreed to anathematize him in 451 during the Council of Chalcedon. From then on, he had no defenders within the empire, but the Church of the East never accepted his condemnation. That led later to western Christians giving the name Nestorian Church to the Church of the East even though it has never regarded him as an authoritative teacher. The discovery and publication of his Book of Heraclides at the beginning of the 20th century have led to a reassessment of his theology in western scholarship. It is now generally agreed that his ideas were not far from those that eventually emerged as orthodox, but the orthodoxy of his formulation of the doctrine of Christ is still controversial. The Second Council of Constantinople of AD 553 confirmed the validity of the condemnation of Nestorius, refuting the letter of Ibas of Edessa that affirms that Nestorius was condemned without due inquiry.",Agent,Cleric,Saint

"Vincent Reynolds Woodland (1879 – 11 December 1933) was a British colonial administrator who was governor of Mongalla Province of the southern Anglo-Egyptian Sudan from 1920 to 1924. VR Woodland was born in 1879 and educated at Marlborough College and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He married Jeannie Claudine Leighton and had two children called Frances Anne and John.He joined the Sudan Political Service in 1904. Woodland was Governor of Mongalla Province from 1920 to 1924, when he retired from the service.He was appointed after the former governor Chauncey Hugh Stigand had killed in October 1919 while trying to suppress a revolt by tribesmen of the Aliyab Dinka.The Aliab Dinka rising was put down harshly in 1920.Woodland wrote that \""The Government has done nothing for the Aliab. It has not protected them from aggression, has given them no economic benefits ... it has forced them to do a certain amount of labour, to pay taxes and to endure a not negligible amount of extortion by police\"". However, although he removed the Egyptian ma'mur at Minkammon who had triggered the Aliab revolt through his abuses, Woodland did not appoint a replacement. The Aliab Dinka were left with no administration at all. In 1920 the Nuer attacked both the Dinka and the Burun people on the border with Ethiopia. Woodland said of Mongala in 1920 that it was \""in such a muck-up state he doesn't know where to start\"".The British were ambivalent about their policy for administration of the South Sudan.Woodland called for a decision. Either South Sudan should be separated from the north and administered as a territory in the same way as Uganda, or the British should encourage development by the Arabs within the structure of the North Sudan. Woodland had to restrain his commissioners from taking an expansionary approach in eastern Mongalla. Talking of the Toposa people of the east, who were threatening the Didinga of Mongalla, he said \""All recent reports of 'the Toposa' attitude towards the government indicate that they must be broken before they will submit to control. Nothing is to be gained by visiting them unless the government intends to occupy and administer their country\"".While Woodland was handicapped by lack of resources, an excellently equipped team of surveyors, engineers and hydrologists undertook a thorough study of the question of a Sudd canal while he was governor. A canal through the vast swampland of the Sudd would open the south of Sudan to navigation, drain the swamps to create agricultural land and by reducing loss through evaporation would increase water available further downstream in north Sudan and Egypt.

On that day, half of the regiment led North Korean forces against South Korean troops by land and sea, pushing them back after several days of fighting. Over the next six weeks the regiment advanced slowly down the Korean Peninsula, acting as a forward unit of the North Korean army. Suffering from a lack of supplies and mounting casualties, the regiment was committed to the Battle of Pusan Perimeter as part of a push to force United Nations (UN) troops out of Korea.

"'Charles Austin' (Ausfather) is an apricot rose cultivar bred and introduced by David Austin in England in 1973. The rose was hybridised by crossing the English rose 'Chaucer' (Austin, 1970) with the pink Hybrid Tea 'Aloha' (Boerner 1949) and is named after the breeder's father. It was one of the early English roses. Double, flat or slightly cupped flowers with a strong, fruity fragrance, and an average diameter of 10 cm (4 inches) appear in small cluster of 3 to 5 in flushes throughout the season. Their colour is an apricot blend, with stronger colours at the petal base, fading to cream at the edges. The flowers have about 70 petals arranged in a quartered bloom form, with the outer ones lighter than the inner ones, and are well suited as cut flowers. The tall and bushy shrub can grow well in excess of 200 cm, especially in warmer climates and is somewhat slow to rebloom, especially if not drastically pruned after the first flush. The cultivar has large leaves and fine, red prickles, is winter hardy up to -20 °C (USDA zone 5b - 10b), but susceptible to black spot and mildew. Due to its size, it can be grown as a freestanding shrub, pegged or trained as a small climber. 'Charles Austin' was further used by Austin as a parent rose and fathered the cultivars 'Leander' (1982), 'Graham Thomas' (1983), 'Swan' (1987), 'Brother Cadfael' (1990), 'Golden Celebration' (1992), 'Tradescant' (1993), 'Teasing Georgia' (1998) and 'Benjamin Britten' (2001).

"Pedra da Mina (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈpɛˌdɾɐˌdaˈmĩˌnɐ]) is the fourth highest mountain in Brazil, located in the Serra Fina section of the Mantiqueira Mountains, one of the country's most important mountain ranges. The mountain stands on the border of the states of Minas Gerais and São Paulo, respectively to its north and south. With a 2,798-metre (9,180-ft) elevation, it is the highest point of the Mantiqueira Mountains and of the state of São Paulo, and the second highest mountain in the state of Minas Gerais. In addition to being one of the highest Brazilian mountains, Pedra da Mina is also remarkable for its peculiar history (see below), as in spite of its high altitude and of being located relatively close to densely populated areas, until the turn of the 21st century the mountain was virtually unknown, so was its exact altitude, and its importance was not acknowledged until very recently, showing that even in the 21st century, geographical exploration may still hold surprises. In this case, official statistics and schoolbooks had to be corrected, and a new popular mountaineering and ecotourism destination appeared. Like all of Serra Fina, Pedra da Mina is composed of highly alkaline nepheline syenite, a type of rock that is easily eroded and for this reason is not usually found at very high altitudes. Pedra da Mina is believed to be the highest mountain made of that type of rock in the Americas and possibly in the world. Pedra means \""rock\"" in Portuguese; mina usually means \""mine\"", but it can also mean \""spring, water source\"". So, the name of the mountain means \""Water Spring Rock\"", and it is due to the fact that four small creeks rise from the mountain close to the top. Pedra da Mina is not located in any national or state park, but it is within the Mantiqueira Mountains Environmental Protection Area, and therefore still legally protected to some extent.",Place,NaturalPlace,Mountain

"Treeswifts or crested swifts are a family, Hemiprocnidae, of aerial near passerine birds, closely related to the true swifts. The family contains a single genus, Hemiprocne, with four species. They are distributed from India and South East Asia through Indonesia to New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Treeswifts are small to medium-sized swifts, ranging in length from 15–30 cm. They have long wings, with most of the length coming from the length of the primaries; their arms are actually quite short. They visibly differ from the other swifts in matters of plumage, which is softer, and they have crests or other facial ornaments, and long forked tails. Anatomically they are separated from the true swifts by skeletal details in the cranium and palate, the anatomy of the tarsus, and a non-reversible hind toe which is used for perching on branches (an activity that true swifts are unable to engage in). The males have iridescent mantle plumage. The treeswifts exhibit a wide range of habitat preferences. One species, the whiskered treeswift, is a species of primary forest. Highly manoeuvrable, it feeds close to vegetation beneath the canopy, and only rarely ventures into secondary forests or plantations, but never over open ground. Other species are less restricted; the crested treeswift makes use of a range of habitats including humid forests and deciduous woodland, and the grey-rumped treeswift utilises occupies almost every habitat type available from the mangrove forests to hill forests. All species feed on insects, although exact details of what prey are taken has not been studied in detail. Nest building responsibilities are shared by the male and female. They lay one egg in the nest, which is glued to an open tree branch. Egg colour varies from white to grey. There is little information about incubation times, but they are thought to be longer for the larger species. Chicks are born with a covering of grey down and are fed a bolus of regurgitated food by the parents.",Species,Animal,Bird

"Frederic Carl Reichardt (born March 16, 1943) was a Major League outfielder for the Los Angeles Angels/California Angels (1964–70), Washington Senators (1970), Chicago White Sox (1971–73) and Kansas City Royals (1973–74). He batted and threw right-handed. Reichardt was a spectacular two-sport star at the University of Wisconsin, twice leading the Big 10 in batting, and starring as a fullback on the 1962 #2 ranked Badgers Rose Bowl team, which was defeated in the 1963 Rose Bowl by #1 ranked USC in the \""comeback that never was\"" where the Badgers scored 23 points in the last 12 minutes, but still lost by 5 points (42 to 37). His athletic prowess was highly rated by all Major League Baseball scouts, and when a bidding war ensued for his signing, he received a $200,000 ($1,545,870 today) signing bonus from the Los Angeles Angels, a record for that time. It was the bidding war for Reichardt that ultimately led Major League Baseball to institute a draft, which started in 1965, with Rick Monday being the first ever #1 overall selection (he was drafted by the Kansas City Athletics). In 1966, Reichardt became the first player to hit a home run at Anaheim Stadium. Later that season, after batting .288 with 16 home runs and 44 RBI through just 89 games, he was diagnosed with a kidney ailment that necessitated the removal of the kidney. Although he recovered to hit .265 with 17 home runs in 1967, and .255 with 21 home runs in 1968, he was never quite the same after the operation. After hitting only 13 home runs in 1969, he was traded with Aurelio Rodríguez to the Washington Senators early in the 1970 season for 3rd baseman Ken McMullen. After a trade to the White Sox in 1971, he managed to hit .278 with 19 homers. From there, age and injuries took their toll and he never again attained double figures in home runs in a season. He retired after 1 at-bat in the 1974 season.",Agent,Athlete,BaseballPlayer

"Timothy Lee Tolman (born April 20, 1956 in Santa Monica, California) is a former Major League Baseball outfielder. Tolman played his college baseball at the University of Southern California and was drafted by the Houston Astros in the 12th round of the 1978 amateur draft. He reached the major leagues in 1981 after batting .322, hitting 14 home runs and having 99 runs batted in for the Tucson Toros of the Pacific Coast League. His OPS was .927. In his seven major league seasons (with the Astros from 1981 through 1985, and the Detroit Tigers in 1986-1987), Tolman could never gain a regular job and hit only .168 for his career, never batting higher than the .196 he posted in 1983. He played two more seasons in the International League (for the Tidewater Tides in 1988 and the Syracuse Chiefs in 1989) before retiring. After his playing career, Tolman managed from 1991-1996 in the Astros' minor-league system. He was a scout in 1997-1999 and a scouting supervisor for the Astros in 2000-2002, then became minor league field coordinator for the Cleveland Indians from 2003 to 2006. Tolman was the third base coach for the Washington Nationals in 2008 and was the subject of criticism. Tolman was fired on September 28, 2008, after the final game of the 2008 season. On January 13, 2009, Tolman was named the Seattle Mariners coordinator of instruction. After the 2009 season, Tolman was hired as bench coach by new Cleveland Indians' new manager, Manny Acta, under whom Tolman had coached in Washington. The relationship between Tolman and Acta goes back to 1991, when Acta played for Tolman, who was managing the Burlington Astros of the Midwest League. Acta later served on Tolman's coaching staff. \""He's a very bright baseball mind. I feel very comfortable with Tim,\"" Acta said. \""He managed me in the minor leagues. I feel like he's a guy that can really help me. He's never been afraid to talk to me, and that is very important for a bench coach.

"The Cingalee, or Sunny Ceylon is a musical play in two acts by James T. Tanner, with music by Lionel Monckton, lyrics by Adrian Ross and Percy Greenbank, and additional material by Paul Rubens. It opened at Daly's Theatre in London, managed by George Edwardes, on March 5, 1904 and ran until March 11, 1905 for a total of 365 (another source giving 391) performances. The musical had a short Broadway run, opening at the Original Daly's Theatre in New York on October 24, 1904 and running for 33 performances. The Cingalee is set in Ceylon and concerns colonial tea planters (one of the most popular songs in the score is called simply \""Tea, tea, tea\""!) in an era before this island paradise became the more troubled Sri Lanka. It was given a showy production and was a success in London. The fashion there for shows set in Asian locales had been started by The Mikado and continued by The Geisha, San Toy, The Nautch Girl, A Chinese Honeymoon and others. There is little in the music to give The Cingalee an Eastern flavour. However, Monckton's catchy sextet, \""The Island of Gay Ceylon\"" and \""Pearl of Sweet Ceylon\"" and Ruben's \""White and Brown Girl\"", \""Sloe Eyes\"", \""Monkeys\"" and \""You and I\"" are highlights of the musical score. The condescending racial nature of The Cingalee's libretto, however, would be unacceptable today, and so The Cingalee is unlikely to be revived. The London cast included Hayden Coffin, Rutland Barrington, Huntley Wright and Isabel Jay. A young Lily Elsie also appeared in the show, as did Topsy Sinden.

"The British general election, 1754, returned members to serve in the House of Commons of the 11th Parliament of Great Britain to be summoned, after the merger of the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland in 1707. Owing to the extensive use of corruption and the Duke of Newcastle's personal influence in the pocket boroughs, the government was returned to office with a working majority. The old parties had disappeared almost completely by this stage; anyone with reasonable hopes of achieving office called himself a 'Whig', although the term had lost most of its original meaning. While 'Tory' and 'Whig' were still used to refer to particular political leanings and tendencies, parties in the old sense were no longer relevant except in a small minority of constituencies, such as Oxfordshire, with most elections being fought on local issues and the holders of political power being determined by the shifting allegiance of factions and aristocratic families rather than the strength or popularity of any organised parties. A small group of members of parliament still considered themselves Tories, but they were almost totally irrelevant to practical politics and entirely excluded from holding public office.

"The black-banded sea krait, or Chinese sea snake (Laticauda semifasciata), known in Japan as erabu umi hebi (ja:エラブウミヘビ), and Okinawa as the irabu, is a member of the Laticauda genus of sea snakes. It is found in most of the warm waters of the western Pacific Ocean. This high snake frequents coral reef areas. It has a short head, thick trunk, and no easily discernible neck. The tail is simply extended skin, spread wide like a fin, and unsupported by any projection. The stomach is comparatively wide. Massing together near the shore, they breed between narrow cracks in the reef and in caves. It is a nocturnal snake, rarely seen during the day. It requires oxygen to breathe, so breaks the surface at least once every six hours. It is too slow to catch fish in a straight chase, so it hunts for fish hiding in the coral. Alternately, gathering in the hundreds, black-banded sea kraits form hunting alliances with yellow goatfish and bluefin trevally, flushing potential prey from narrow crannies in a reef the same way some moray eels do. The bite is highly venomous and paralyzes the prey. Females lay their eggs on land. Generally, the species is found in Fiji, southern Japan and Singapore. Their venom is ten times stronger than that of a cobra, making them extremely dangerous. Fortunately, this snake does not bite humans unless it feels threatened. The erabu snake is a winter staple in southern Japan, where it is believed to replenish a female's womanhood. Irabu soup irabu-jiru (ja:イラブー汁) is said to taste like miso and a bit like tuna.

"The Battle of the Philippine Sea (June 19–20, 1944) was a decisive naval battle of World War II that eliminated the Imperial Japanese Navy's ability to conduct large-scale carrier actions. It took place during the United States' amphibious invasion of the Mariana Islands during the Pacific War. The battle was the last of five major \""carrier-versus-carrier\"" engagements between American and Japanese naval forces, and pitted elements of the United States Navy's Fifth Fleet against ships and aircraft of the Imperial Japanese Navy's Mobile Fleet and nearby island garrisons. The aerial theatre of the battle was nicknamed the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot by American aviators for the severely disproportional loss ratio inflicted upon Japanese aircraft by American pilots and anti-aircraft gunners. During a debriefing after the first two air battles a pilot from USS Lexington remarked \""Why, hell, it was just like an old-time turkey shoot down home!\"" The outcome is generally attributed to American improvements in pilot and crew training and tactics, war technology (including the top-secret anti-aircraft proximity fuze), and ship and aircraft design. Although at the time the battle appeared to be a missed opportunity to destroy the Japanese fleet, the Imperial Japanese Navy had lost the bulk of its carrier air strength and would never recover.

There he met Juan's youngest sister, Caridad, his future wife and mother to his children: Rosario, Milagros, Paz, Lourdes and Carlos Jr. Shortly after World War II, he decided to open his own office in partnership with Alfredo J. Luz. In 1955, both parted ways and practiced separately. His first exposure to the INC group was executed under Nakpil's company through the Bishop's Palace in San Juan, Manila. INC gave the subsequent project directly to Santos-Viola. Although common elements may be visible, his designs were distinct from one another. Each structure was created on functionality that was built with integrity, adorned with 20th-century geometric forms garnished with Gothic revival and Baroque lines. Among those completed designs was the INC's central office in Quezon City. Architect Santos-Viola was the only Filipino Architect who designed churches that were built all over the Philippines. Carlos was a lifelong devout Roman Catholic. He ministered for the Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Quezon City and was frequently invited to join the INC but repeatedly denied the invitations due to ideological differences. He also taught architecture at the college where he graduated, and helped found the Philippine Institute of Architects in 1938.",Agent,Person,Architect

"Udo was a 9th-century nobleman of East Francia, a son of Gebhard, Count of Lahngau, and older brother of Berengar I of Neustria. He and his brother were afforded their position in the March of Neustria both by kinship to Adalard the Seneschal and the favour of Charles the Bald. With his brothers, Berengar and Waldo the Abbot, he took part in the 861 revolt of Carloman of Bavaria, possible his cousin-in-law, against Louis the German. The revolt was crushed and the three brothers fled with their relative Adalard to the court of the West Frankish king, Charles the Bald, who granted them wardship of the march against the Vikings while the march against the Bretons was granted to Robert the Strong. Charles' patronage of the family provoked the jealousy of the Rorgonids, the most powerful family local to Neustria and then controlling the ducatus Cenomannicus (Maine). In 865, they allied with Saloman of Brittany and attacked the brothers. Charles, to attain peace, took the march back and gave it to Gauzfrid, a Rorgonid. A charter of 879 mentions Udo and his brothers taking part in the foundation of the college of Gemünden. Evidently, the death of Louis the German in 876 had allowed them to return to the court of Carloman.

"Diego Rodríguez Porcelos (governed 873 – c. 885), was the second Count of Castile, succeeding his father Rodrigo.

"Guibert or Wibert of Ravenna (c. 1029 – 8 September 1100) was an Italian prelate, archbishop of Ravenna, who was elected pope in 1080 in opposition to Pope Gregory VII. Gregory was the leader of the movement in the church which opposed the traditional claim of European monarchs to control ecclesiastical appointments, and this was opposed by supporters of monarchical rights led by the Holy Roman Emperor. This led to the conflict known as the Investiture Controversy. Gregory was felt by many to have gone too far when he excommunicated the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV and supported a rival claimant as emperor, and in 1080 the pro-imperial Synod of Brixen pronounced that Gregory was deposed and replaced as pope by Guibert. Consecrated as Pope Clement III in Rome in March of 1084, he commanded a significant following in Rome and elsewhere, especially during the first half of his pontificate, and reigned in opposition to four successive popes in the anti-imperial line: Gregory VII, Victor III, Urban II, and Paschal II. After his death and burial at Civita Castellana in 1100 he was celebrated locally as a miracle-working saint, but Paschal II and the anti-imperial party soon subjected him to a thorough deletio and damnatio memoriae, which included the exhuming and dumping of his remains in the Tiber.

Tchen was born in Chungking, wartime capital of China during the Second Sino-Japanese War (more commonly known amongst Chinese as the War of Resistance). His father was then a junior diplomat with the Chinese Government and was posted overseas when Tchen was two years old. Tchen followed his father to various postings and never returned to China to live, except for two years (1954–56) in Taiwan, where the Nationalist government under Chiang Kai-Shek had fled after losing the mainland in the Chinese Civil War. His father continued to represent the Republic of China government until 1975 when he retired to live with Tchen in Australia. In 1958, Tchen gained a student visa to Australia to study—at that time, the only way for Asians to enter Australia due to the White Australia Policy. Eventually, he obtained a master's degree in town planning at Sydney University. From 1966, Tchen worked as a New South Wales government town planner in Sydney. Harold Holt succeeded Robert Menzies as Prime Minister in 1965 and effectively ended the White Australia Policy by altering the immigration law to allow Asian migration. After weighing up his choices, Tchen decided to remain in Australia, and gained citizenship in 1971.

"The Cretzschmar's bunting (Emberiza caesia) is a passerine bird in the bunting family Emberizidae, a group now separated by most modern authors from the finches, Fringillidae. It breeds in Greece, Turkey, Cyprus and the coastal countries along the eastern edge of the Mediterranean. It is migratory, wintering in the Sudan. It is a very rare wanderer to western Europe. Cretzschmar's bunting breeds on sunny open hillsides with some bushes. It is mainly coastal or insular, and often breeds at lower levels than the closely related ortolan bunting where both occur. It lays four to six eggs in a ground nest. Its natural food consists of seeds and when feeding young, insects. This bird is smaller than ortolan. The breeding male has a grey head with orange moustaches. The upperparts are brown and heavily streaked, except on the rump, and the underparts are rusty orange. The stout bill is pink. Females and young birds have a weaker head pattern, and are more similar to ortolans. They can be distinguished by the warm brown rump and white eye-ring. The English name commemorates the German physician and scientist Philipp Jakob Cretzschmar who founded the Senckenberg Natural History Museum. The genus name Emberiza is from Old German Embritz, a bunting. The specific caesias is from Latin caesius, \""bluish-grey\"".",Species,Animal,Bird

"The Campaign for a More Prosperous Britain was a political party in the United Kingdom. It was founded prior to the February 1974 general election by Tom Keen and Harold Smith, both business owners in Manchester. Keen was the party's leader. He had become a millionaire through property development, and before forming the campaign, had donated money to the National Front. The party called for voters not to vote for its candidates, but for tactical voting to defeat the Labour Party; it distributed anti-Labour literature. Despite this, some of its candidacies received hundreds of votes, with Keen's candidacy in Portsmouth South at the October 1974 UK general election attracting 1.0% of all the votes cast. The party first came to public attention when members plastered the headquarters of the Trades Union Congress with anti-union posters. It was also strongly opposed to the Communist Party of Great Britain. Smith stood against Labour Party leader Harold Wilson at the February 1974 UK general election, taking 234 votes. At the October general election, Keen and Smith set a new record by standing simultaneously in eleven and twelve constituencies, respectively. With two associates who stood in a single constituency each, the campaign stood in a total of 25 seats, receiving 4,301 votes.

"Fabian (Latin: Fabianus; c. 200 – 20 January 250) was the Bishop of Rome from 10 January 236 to his death in 250, succeeding Anterus. He is famous for the miraculous nature of his election, in which a dove is said to have descended on his head to mark him as the Holy Spirit's unexpected choice to become the next pope. He was succeeded by Cornelius. Most of his papacy was characterized by amicable relations with the imperial government, and Fabian could thus bring back to Rome the bodies of Pope Pontian and the antipope Hippolytus, both of whom had died in exile in the Sardinian mines, for Christian burial. It was also probably during his reign that the schism between the two corresponding Roman congregations of these leaders was ended. He was highly esteemed by Cyprian; Novatian refers to his nobilissima memoriae, and he corresponded with Origen. One authority refers to him as Flavian. The Liber Pontificalis, a fourth-century document that survives in later copies, says that he divided Rome into deaconates and appointed secretaries to collect the records of the martyrs. He is also said, probably without basis, to have baptized the emperor Philip the Arab and his son. More plausible is the report in the Liberian Catalogue that he sent out seven \""apostles to the Gauls\"" as missionaries.

There is no reference to a church or priest in the entry for the parish in the Domesday Book, which was complied in 1086. This may indicate the absence of a church building at that stage or, alternatively, only the absence of a resident priest. Most of the current church building was erected in the 13th and 14th centuries and is constructed of square coursed lias with ashlar dressings and a slate roof. There is a chancel, a clerestoried nave of four bays with a south aisle, north porch and west tower. The chancel arch is of 15th-century construction, when it appears that significant further work was carried out such as the addition of the clerestory and porch as well as widening of the aisle. A monument whose Latin inscription commemorates Alexander Ibbs, a rector of the parish who died in 1606, is set in the north wall of the chancel. The church was extensively restored in 1874-5. Alterations at that time included the creation of a vestry and an organ chamber, both leading from the chancel, provision of a barrel roof to the chancel, a new roof to the aisle, removal of a west gallery and alterations to some of the windows.

"The Portuguese conquest of Goa occurred in 1510 on behalf of the Portuguese admiral D. Afonso de Albuquerque. Goa (also Old Goa or Velha Goa) was not among the cities Albuquerque had received orders to conquer: he had only been ordered by the Portuguese king to capture Hormuz, Aden and Malacca. Albuquerque attacked Goa at the invitation of a local chieftain Thimayya, an exiled Hindu from Goa who was admiral of the Honavar fleet who had received appeals from the Hindu population of Goa to relieve them from Muslim rule. Goa was a great and prosperous trading port on the Indian coast. Albuquerque first reached the city of Goa with his admiral António de Noronha in February 1510. Albuquerque triumphantly entered the city on 17 February 1510, with little conflict. A Muslim force then approached to reconquer Goa. Besieged, the Portuguese finally abandoned Goa on 30 May 1510 to its former ruler Ismail Adil Shah, the Muslim king of Bijapur. Albuquerque sailed from Cannanore (capital of Kolathunad) and returned three months later, on November 24, with a stronger fleet, composed of 34 ships, 1500 Portuguese and 300 Malabarese. He again joined forces with Thimayya in Honavar. He was fearing an alliance of Goa with Gujarat, Zamorin's Calicut and the Mamluk Egyptians. Albuquerque was then able to capture Goa in less than a day, from Ismail Adil Shah and his Ottoman allies, who surrendered on 10 December. \""As soon as the Portuguese were in entire possession of Goa, Albuquerque directed that the Muhammadan population, men, women and children, should be put to the sword. This cruel butchery is far more to Albuquerque's discredit than the hanging of Ruy Dias, for which the poet Camoens so strongly condemns him.\"" Thereafter, Goa then supplanted Calicut in prosperity. Albuquerque had captured Goa without royal orders, and was opposed by his captains in doing so. The king challenged the Portuguese establishment at Goa, but the council of the fidalgos finally confirmed the possession, to the displeasure of the king. The city of Goa nevertheless constituted a strong position that reinforced the strategic presence of the Portuguese in India. The Portuguese did continue to have misgivings about their possessions in India, as they discussed in 1542 and 1570 whether they should abandon the Estado da Índia in order to better concentrate on the conquest of Morocco.",Event,SocietalEvent,MilitaryConflict

"Ruacana is a town in Omusati Region, northern Namibia and the district capital of the Ruacana electoral constituency. It is located on the border with Angola on the river Kunene. The town is known for the picturesque Ruacana Falls nearby, and for the Ruacana Power Station. Ruacana was developed around a major underground hydroelectric plant linked to the nearby dam across the border in Angola at Calueque. The dam and pumping station were bombed in a Cuban airstrike in 1988, during the Angolan Civil War. The facility was partially repaired and today NamPower operates three turbines producing a maximum of 240 megawatts. OvaZemba and OvaHimba people are native to the area. The name Ruacana originated from one of the first settlers in Ruacana called Ruhakana. The town was therefore named after Mr. Ruhakana although it is currently written as Ruacana. Ruacana's settlement status was upgraded to that of a village in 2005, and to town in 2010. It is now governed by a town council that has seven seats. The place normally receives an annual average rainfall of 426 millimetres (16.8 in), although in the 2010/2011 rainy season 960 millimetres (38 in) were measured.

"Lake Istokpoga is a 26,762.9-acre (108.306 km2) freshwater lake in Highlands County, Florida. It is fed by two creeks, Arbuckle Creek and Josephine Creek. The oblong-shaped lake is approximately 5 miles (8.0 km) wide by 10 miles (16 km) long. It is considered the fifth largest lake in the state of Florida. Despite its area, it is very shallow, with an average depth of only 4 feet (1.2 m). Maximum depth is 10 feet (3.0 m). As a result, boaters must be cautious to not become stranded in muck near the shore line. Bass and pontoon boats are the most commonly used watercraft, with some use of airboats. With such shallowness, this lake is extremely dangerous for boaters during windstorms, as the waves get quite high. Boating and fishing are popular activities at this lake. There are at least half a dozen fish camps on Lake Istokpoga. Several of these fish camps book visitors for fishing trips and they also have cabins and hook up for campers, for overnight stays. The amenities on the lake are 5 public boat ramps and 2 public parks, one on the lake's north side and the other on the south east corner. Most of the shoreline is undeveloped and there are two islands, Big and Bumble Bee, in the lake's interior. Some residential properties and private boat docks and beaches dot areas on the shore. Local legend is that the word Istokpoga is of the Seminole language meaning \""a lake where was someone was killed in the water\"" because a group of Seminole Indians attempted to cross the lake and were bogged in the mire and swallowed by whirlpools.

"The 2006 German Grand Prix (formally the Mobil 1 Grand Prix of Germany) was a Formula One motor race held at the Hockenheimring on 30 July 2006. The 67-lap race was the twelfth round of the 2006 Formula One season and was won Michael Schumacher. The Grand Prix weekend got off to a controversial start when the mass damper system fitted by Renault was deemed legal by the FIA appointed stewards, despite the FIA banning the use of these devices. The FIA appealed against the steward's decision, but Renault then withdrew the system after Friday practice to avoid further sanctions. Kimi Räikkönen took pole position, but it proved artificial as McLaren had inadvertently not put enough fuel as intended in his car before qualifying. In the race, Räikkönen's early pitstop left him unable to challenge at the front, and the way was left clear for Ferrari to score a dominant one-two. Perhaps due to the damper issue, Renault were not competitive; it was the first time in 2006 that neither of their cars finished the race on the podium. Sakon Yamamoto made his Formula One début at the Grand Prix, starting from pit lane after changing chassis after the qualifying session. He was not the only one to suffer changes after qualifying, as Jarno Trulli and Christijan Albers both had to change engines, incurring ten-place penalties.

The existence of mainland and insular populations of this species has been valuable in providing biologists with study and control groups comparing the evolution of island populations and their mainland counterparts. The San Esteban Island subspecies (C.h. conspicuosa) coexists with the giant San Esteban chuckwalla, contrary to predictions of ecological niche theory.",Species,Animal,Reptile

"The BMW M52 is a straight-6 DOHC piston engine which was produced from 1994-2000. It was released in the E36 320i, to replace the M50. It was replaced by the M54 engine. Compared with its M50 predecessor, the M52 uses an aluminium block. However, North American models used iron blocks instead (except in the Z3), therefore the North American M52 is more akin to the M50TU. Like the M50TU, the M52 uses variable valve timing on the intake camshaft (called single VANOS by BMW). In 1998, the M52TU (\""technical update\"") was released, adding variable valve timing to the exhaust camshaft (called dual VANOS by BMW). Other upgrades included electronic throttle control (which uses a throttle cable as backup), a dual length intake manifold (called \""DISA\"" by BMW) and revised cylinder liners.

These included Gruffudd ap Nicholas, an esquire prominent in the administration of South Wales, who was also praised by Lewys Glyn Cothi and Dafydd ap Edmund; Dafydd ap Ieuan ab Owain of Caereinion; and Dafydd Llwyd ap Dafydd ab Einion of Newtown. He also produced some fine elegies, religious verse and love poems: 27 works attributed to him have been preserved in manuscript, though not all are certainly by him. Despite many of his poems being preserved, almost nothing is known of Gwilym's life. Ieuan Gethin, a contemporary, composed a somewhat sarcastic elegy on Gwilym's father Ieuan, a thatcher who died after falling off a roof. Gwilym's works were edited in 1992 by A. Eleri Davies along with those of Deio ab Ieuan Du.",Agent,Writer,Poet

"Mount Saint Nicholas is a peak in the remote southwestern section of Glacier National Park, in Montana, United States. It is a particularly steep, pointed rock pinnacle, and its distinctive profile is visible from many summits in the southern half of the park. Because even its easiest ascent route is technical, with poor rock quality, it is \""considered the most dangerous and difficult mountain for climbers in Glacier National Park.\"" Mount Saint Nicholas excels in terms of steep vertical relief, even by the high standards prevalent in Glacier National Park. For example, its northwest face rises one vertical mile (5,280 ft/1,609 m) in approximately 1.5 horizontal miles (7,920 ft/2.4 km). Due to its pointed shape and isolation from the Continental Divide, it has similarly precipitous drops in all directions. In 1926, Reverend Conrad Wellen, of Havre, Montana, made the first ascent of Mount Saint Nicholas. This was a significant achievement, since the mountain had been considered by many to be unclimbable. The standard route is the Northeast Ridge. Starting from the east side of the peak, this route begins with a straightforward scramble up a gully to a prominent notch. From the notch a thousand vertical feet of somewhat technical climbing remain.",Place,NaturalPlace,Mountain
"Varany Maha Vidyalayam (Tamil: வரணி மகா வித்தியாலயம் Varaṇi Makā Vittiyālayam) is a provincial school in Varany, Sri Lanka. Locating the school at Varany was due to the untiring efforts of V. Sithamparanathan who was a towering figure at Varany Village Council for 30 years, the last 18 as Chairman. Constructing a secondary school in the southern part of Thenmaradchi District was mooted by V. Kumarasamy the then Member of Parliament for Chavakachcheri, with a decision resulting in selecting Kodikamam as the venue. Even construction materials began arriving at the site when Mr. Sithamparanathan took it upon himself as a crusader to build the secondary school at Varany instead. Kodikamam is located at a main railway station with good road and rail access to established schools in Chavakachcheri, only 5 miles away. Even better schools in Jaffna town were equally accessible by rail or road to students in that vicinity. Such was not the case with Varany, a village of much larger land area with a predominantly agrarian base. For historical reasons such as resisting educational developments based on religious lines, Varany residents did not take to western education like the rest of the peninsula. When the winds of change blew a bit harder, it became apparent to leaders like Mr. Sithamparanathan that unless education was built into the future fabric of life, Varany residents would be left behind. There were several vernacular and primary schools in the village, including the American Mission Tamil Mixed School which was built through the philanthropy of Mr. Sithamparanathan himself, partly as a compromise for not allowing the construction of a secondary school in Varany by the missionaries who then took the project to Udupiddy in the form of the current Udupiddy American Mission College. Students from Varany had to trek long distances by foot to get to the main road, take buses or vans to either Point Pedro or to Kodikamam and take another bus or van to Chavakachcheri if they aspired to higher education. A few would even go further to schools in the Jaffna town enduring even more hardship. Locating a secondary school in a location central to the Village Council's boundaries so that the catchment is equitably served in terms of travel distance was a key consideration. The visionaries of the time would have been very pleased to see the fruits of their labour in ample supply as evidenced in the publication of the school's 50th Anniversary Commemoration in 2004.",Agent,EducationalInstitution,School

"Pērkonkrusts (Latvian pronunciation: [ˈpeːr.kon.krusts], \""Thunder Cross\""), was a Latvian ultra-nationalist, anti-German and antisemitic political party founded in 1933 by Gustavs Celmiņš, borrowing elements of German nationalism—but being unsympathetic to German National Socialism at the time—and Italian fascism. It was outlawed in 1934, its leadership arrested, and Celmiņš eventually exiled in 1937. Still-imprisoned members were persecuted under the first Soviet occupation; some collaborated with subsequently invading Nazi Germany forces in perpetrating the Holocaust. Pērkonkrusts continued to exist in some form until 1944, when Celmiņš, who had initially returned to work in the occupying German administration, was imprisoned. Following the restoration of Latvia's independence in 1991, a new radical nationalist movement, also called Pērkonkrusts, was formed in 1995.

The Grand chord section is the lifeline of the country on which Coal, Steel and other important goods are moved from Eastern section to Western and Northern sections of the country. In the down direction, the traffic consists of mostly food grains, fertilizers and empty wagons for coal loading in the Bihar and West Bengal coal fields. Mughalsarai is a transit division and the main objective is to maintain mobility of high density traffic. The present capacity of the Grand Chord is being optimally utilized. Traversing through Chhota Nagpur plateau of Jharkhand as well as parts of the fertile Gangetic plains of Bihar, the Grand Chord covers a stretch of 450 km. The railways first came to eastern India in 1854, and the Calcutta–Delhi railway link, with a distance of more than 1636 km, became operational by 1866. With the increase in traffic it became necessary to construct an alternative route. With this in view, The Grand Chord section was planned. The Grand Chord section was opened in December, 1906 by Lord Minto, then Viceroy and Governor General of India with a function at Gujahandi. With the opening of the Grand Chord route, the distance between Calcutta and Delhi was reduced by 80 km. The cost of construction was around Rs. 41,500,000.

"The fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) is possibly the best-known salamander species in Europe. It is black with yellow spots or stripes to a varying degree; some specimens can be nearly completely black while on others the yellow is dominant. Shades of red and orange may sometimes appear, either replacing or mixing with the yellow according to subspecies. Fire salamanders can have a very long lifespan; one specimen lived for more than 50 years in Museum Koenig, a German natural history museum. Fire salamanders live in central European forests and are more common in hilly areas. They prefer deciduous forests, since they like to hide in fallen leaves and around mossy tree trunks. They need small brooks or ponds with clean water in their habitat for the development of the larvae. Whether on land or in water, fire salamanders are inconspicuous. They spend much of their time hidden under wood or other objects. They are active in the evening and the night, but on rainy days they are active in daytime as well. The diet of the fire salamander consists of various insects, spiders, earthworms and slugs, but they also occasionally eat newts and young frogs. In captivity, they eat crickets, mealworms, waxworms and silkworm larvae. Small prey will be caught within the range of the vomerine teeth or by the posterior half of the tongue, to which the prey adheres. It weighs about 40 grams.

"CKVM-FM is a French-language Canadian radio station located in Ville-Marie, Quebec. Owned and operated by Radio Témiscamingue (a non-profit organization), it broadcasts on 93.1 MHz with an effective radiated power of 18,400 watts and a peak effective radiated power of 34,000 watts (class B) using an omnidirectional antenna. The station has an adult contemporary music format. The station operates a small relay, CKVM-FM-1 in Témiscaming, which broadcasts on 92.1 MHz with an effective radiated power of 10 watts (class LP) using an omnidirectional antenna. Previously known as CKVM when the station was on the AM band on 710 kHz, the station moved to FM in 2004. The station went on the air on January 7, 1950 on 710 kHz, originally using 1,000 watts full-time (and using a directional antenna at night). Daytime power was increased from 1,000 watts to 10,000 watts in August 1961. In 1968, CKVM opened up an AM radio station at Témiscaming, Québec on 1340 kHz as CKVT. In 1988, CKVT was authorized to move to FM at 92.1 MHz, until it went dark in 1992, when it was replaced by the current CKVM-FM-1. CKVM was widely known for failing to follow its nighttime technical parameters by operating at night with 10,000 watts omnidirectional, therefore causing interference to American clear channel station WOR in New York City. The station admitted this situation during a Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) public hearing in 2001. Part of the problem was that CKVM lost two of its three towers at some point during the 1990s and was unable to replace them. The station's move to FM was done in large part to solve these technical problems. The station was an affiliate of Radio-Canada's Première Chaîne from August 1953 until 2002. CKVM was one of the last private affiliate radio stations to disaffiliate from Radio-Canada.",Agent,Broadcaster,RadioStation

Naedyceras was named by Hyatt in 1884; Gonionaedyceras, and Gyronaedyceras by Flower in 1945. All three have open, gyroconic coiling, a subtriangular whorl section with a flattened dorsum. The siphuncle in each is ventral with flared out, cyrochoanitic septal necks and internal, longitudinal blade-like actinosiphonate deposits. All three come from the Middle Devonian of N Am, specifically New York, Ohio, and Wisconsin. Differences lie primarily in the symmetry of the whorl section and in the suture. Naedyceras is described as having a loosely coiled low-spired coiled dextral torticonoc. or trochoidal, shell with a flattened dorsum and subtriangular whorl section. The body chamber bulges slightly. The aperture in mature specimens is somewhat contracted. Sutures form slight lateral lobes, dorsal lobes, and broad ventral and umbilical saddles. Whorl section is symmetric. Gonionaedyceras' has a strongly curved cyrtoconic shell with an asymmetric subtriangular whorl section. The inside, or dorsal, curvature is obliquely flattened and sides converge onto a narrow, ventral, outside curvature that bears a rounded to angular ridge. Sutures have dorsal and lateral lobes and umbilical and ventral saddles. Umbilical saddles are sharper on the left than on the right. Ventral saddles are rounded. Gyronaedyceras has a compressed gyroconic shell of about two volutions with an assymmnetrical, subtraingular whorl section having a broadly rounded to subangular venter and flat dorsum. Sutures are essentially straight and transverse. Actinosphonate structures are discretely developed. Naedyceras, most especially, outwardly resembles Stereotoceras, which in contrast has a depressed, wider than high, cross section and a beaded, nummuloidal siphuncle.

"The Last of Us is an action-adventure survival horror video game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. It was released for the PlayStation 3 in June 2013. An updated version, The Last of Us Remastered, was released for the PlayStation 4 in July 2014. In the game, players control Joel, a man tasked with escorting a teenage girl named Ellie across a post-apocalyptic United States. The Last of Us is played from a third-person perspective; players use firearms and improvised weapons, and can use stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. \""Listen Mode\"" allows players to locate enemies through a heightened sense of hearing and spatial awareness. Weapons can also be upgraded using items scavenged from the environment. In the game's online multiplayer mode, up to eight players engage in co-operative and competitive gameplay in recreations of single-player settings. Development of The Last of Us began in 2009, soon after the release of Naughty Dog's previous game, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. The relationship between Joel and Ellie was the central focus of the game, with all other elements developed around it. The team chose actors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson to portray Joel and Ellie respectively, who provided voice and motion capture for the roles. Both assisted creative director Neil Druckmann with the development of the characters and story. The original score was composed and performed by Gustavo Santaolalla. Following its announcement in December 2011, The Last of Us was widely anticipated. It was acclaimed by many reviewers, with praise particularly directed at its characterization, subtext, exploration of the human condition, and depiction of female characters. The Last of Us became one of the best-selling PlayStation 3 games, selling over 1.3 million units in its first week, and over eight million units within fourteen months. Considered to be one of the greatest video games of all time, it won year-end accolades, including multiple Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications, critics, and game award shows, making it one of the most awarded games in history. After the game's release, Naughty Dog released several downloadable content additions; The Last of Us: Left Behind added a new single-player campaign, taking place both before and during the main story, featuring Ellie and her best friend Riley.",Work,Software,VideoGame

"Malinky is a Scottish folk band specialising in Scots song. Formed in autumn 1998, the original members were Karine Polwart from Banknock, Stirlingshire (vocals, guitar, bouzouki), Steve Byrne from Arbroath (vocals, guitar, bouzouki, mandolin), Mark Dunlop from Garryduff, Co. Antrim (bodhrán, whistles, vocals) and fiddler Kit Patterson from Plymouth, England. First meeting to rehearse in early October 1998, the band was largely formed to help Polwart fulfil a support slot at Edinburgh Folk Club some ten days later, supporting harpist and storyteller Robin Williamson, formerly of the Incredible String Band. The members had previously encountered each other around the lively pub session scene in Edinburgh in venues such as Sandy Bell's and the Royal Oak bars. Polwart was a social worker, Byrne a student of Scottish Studies, Dunlop a town planner with the city council, and Patterson a computer programmer. Amidst the plethora of good young instrumental bands on the scene, Malinky stood out owing to their almost exclusive concentration on Scots traditional song, as well as Polwart's burgeoning songwriting talent. Within six months the band had won a 'Danny Award' for new talent at Glasgow's Celtic Connections festival and were signed to the leading Scottish independent folk imprint Greentrax Recordings, as well as kicking off their international career with a trip to the Festival Interceltique de Lorient in Brittany. The band's first album 'Last Leaves' was recorded in 1999 and released at Celtic Connections 2000, with Davy Steele as producer. The album was recorded at Pier House Studios in Granton, Edinburgh. In 2000, the band were invited to perform at Denmark's prestigious Tønder Festival and the UK's Cambridge Folk Festival. In early 2001, Edinburgh-born Jon Bews, formerly of Bùrach, replaced Patterson on fiddle, and later that year Tyrone button box and whistle player Leo McCann was asked to join to expand the band's largely string-driven sound. McCann toured with the band for the first time on the Scottish Folk Festival tour of Germany in January 2002, where the band honed the material for their second album on Greentrax, 3 Ravens. Launched on their return visit to Cambridge Folk Festival in August 2002, the band's recording of the traditional song 'Billy Taylor' set to Polwart's tune attracted the attention of BBC Radio 2's Mike Harding and significant airplay boosted the band's profile considerably. Polwart's song 'Thaney', about the Scottish Saint Thenew, (more commonly known as Enoch), earned a nomination in the 2003 Radio 2 Folk Awards. 3 Ravens also showcased Byrne's own growing songwriting talents for the first time, with his Angus Scots lament 'The Lang Road Doon'. 3 Ravens was recorded at Castlesound Studios in Pencaitland, East Lothian.",Agent,Group,Band

Potton is located about 125 kilometres (78 mi) southeast of Montreal, 30 kilometres (19 mi) to the southwest of the city of Magog, and next to the United States border, north of North Troy, Vermont. Potton Township (Canton de Potton) consists of several villages and hamlets that include Potton Springs, Mansonville, Highwater, Dunkin, Province Hill, Leadville, Vale Perkins, Perkins Landing, and Knowlton's Landing. Of these, Mansonville is the business center and the seat of government (Municipalite du canton de Potton) for the township. Formerly a sleepy community, Mansonville has experienced some growth and prosperity because of its proximity to the Owl's Head ski resort. Like many Eastern Townships and New England villages, Mansonville grew up around a water-powered mill which exploited a head of water above a fall on the North Branch of the Missisquoi River. The mill ceased operating with electrification in the early 20th century, which allowed economies of scale and centralized manufacturing in larger centres. It operated as a feed and grain mill until 2004, when it was destroyed by fire. Overlooking the mill site is the mansion of the Manson family that founded the town. The mansion has since become a bed and breakfast. The Central Maine and Quebec Railway railroad route from Newport, Vermont to Richford, Vermont traverses the township at Highwater and follows the Mississquoi River.

"Sir John Vanbrugh (/ˈvænbrə/; 24 January 1664 (baptised) – 26 March 1726) was an English architect and dramatist, perhaps best known as the designer of Blenheim Palace and Castle Howard. He wrote two argumentative and outspoken Restoration comedies, The Relapse (1696) and The Provoked Wife (1697), which have become enduring stage favourites but originally occasioned much controversy. He was knighted in 1714. Vanbrugh was in many senses a radical throughout his life. As a young man and a committed Whig, he was part of the scheme to overthrow James II, put William III on the throne and protect English parliamentary democracy, and he was imprisoned by the French as a political prisoner. In his career as a playwright, he offended many sections of Restoration and 18th century society, not only by the sexual explicitness of his plays, but also by their messages in defence of women's rights in marriage. He was attacked on both counts, and was one of the prime targets of Jeremy Collier's Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage. In his architectural career, he created what came to be known as English Baroque. His architectural work was as bold and daring as his early political activism and marriage-themed plays, and jarred conservative opinions on the subject.",Agent,Person,Architect

"The Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 was the final and most devastating of the series of wars fought between the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire and the Sasanian Empire of Persia. The previous war between the two powers had ended in 591 after Emperor Maurice helped the Sasanian king Khosrau II regain his throne. In 602 Maurice was murdered by his political rival Phocas. Khosrau proceeded to declare war, ostensibly to avenge the death of Maurice. This became a decades-long conflict, the longest war in the series, and was fought throughout the Middle East and eastern Europe: in Egypt, the Levant, Mesopotamia, the Caucasus, Anatolia, Armenia and even before the walls of Constantinople itself. While the Persians proved largely successful during the first stage of the war from 602 to 622, conquering much of the Levant, Egypt, and parts of Anatolia, the ascendancy of emperor Heraclius in 610 led, despite initial setbacks, to the Persians' defeat. Heraclius' campaigns in Persian lands from 622 to 626 forced the Persians onto the defensive, allowing his forces to regain momentum. Allied with the Avars and Slavs, the Persians made a final attempt to take Constantinople in 626, but were defeated there. In 627 Heraclius invaded the heartland of the Persians and forced them to sue for peace. By the end of the conflict both sides had exhausted their human and material resources. Consequently, they were vulnerable to the sudden emergence of the Islamic Rashidun Caliphate, whose forces invaded both empires only a few years after the war. The Muslim forces swiftly conquered the entire Sasanian Empire and deprived the Byzantine Empire of its territories in the Levant, the Caucasus, Egypt, and North Africa. Over the following centuries, half the Byzantine Empire and the entire Sasanian Empire came under Muslim rule.",Event,SocietalEvent,MilitaryConflict

"The Democratic Representative Caucus was a group of Members of the Canadian Parliament who left the Canadian Alliance in 2001 in protest against the leadership of Stockwell Day. Following the Alliance's disappointing performance in the 2000 election, Day came under severe criticism from his own party. Several high-profile Alliance MPs began publicly calling for him to step down. Through the spring of 2001, several members of the Alliance resigned their shadow cabinet seats, the most high-profile resignation being that of deputy leader Deborah Grey. On May 2, Art Hanger was the first Alliance MP suspended from caucus for criticizing Day. Over the next two months, 11 other Alliance MPs were either suspended from caucus or resigned. On May 16, Hanger was followed by Chuck Strahl, Gary Lunn, Jim Pankiw, Val Meredith, Grant McNally, Jay Hill and Jim Gouk. In late June, they were joined by Monte Solberg, Andy Burton and Brian Fitzpatrick, and in the first week of July by Inky Mark and Grey. Through the summer, this group of MPs sat as \""Independent Alliance Caucus\"", and were jokingly dubbed the \""Rebel Alliance\"" by political commentators. In early September, an offer was made to the MPs in which they would be readmitted to the Alliance caucus if they promised to refrain from criticizing Day's leadership. The MPs surveyed their constituents, and on September 10, the offer was accepted by Hanger, Gouk, Solberg, Fitzpatrick and Burton. The remaining seven MPs refused, and formed the Democratic Representative Caucus on September 12, with Strahl as its parliamentary leader and Grey as deputy leader.

"Angelosaurus dolani ('Dolan's Angel lizard', Olson & Berrbower 1953) was a pelycosaur (an extinct clade) of reptile. It is known from a partial skull from the Middle San Angelo Formation, Knox County, Texas, USA. It dates from the Kungurian (Early Permian). It was from three to three and a half metres long and weighed about 300 kilograms. It belongs to the family Caseidae. Like its contemporary, another caseid, Cotylorhynchus, it was large, heavily built, and herbivorous. It also shared its environment with the caseids Caseoides and Caseopsis. It may have been preyed upon by the large sphenacodont pelycosaur Dimetrodon. Like all caseids, Angelosaurus was an evolutionarily conservative reptile which would appear to have been one of the dominant herbivores of the time, occupying a similar ecological role to cows. Caseid skulls are distinguished from other pelycosaurs by large temporal openings, large nasal and pineal openings and an upper jaw that distinctively overhangs the teeth of the lower jaw.The skull is pitted. The teeth are uniform. The body was probably barrel-shaped, like other caseids, with massive limbs and small cervical vertebrae. And unlike the better-known pelycosaurs such as Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus, caseids do not have the exaggerated elongation of the vertebrae that form a sail. Two other species of Angelosaurus have been described so far: Angelosaurus greeni Olson 1962, and Angelosaurus romeri Olson and Barghusen, 1962.",Species,Animal,Reptile

Originally from Tennessee, Staub received a master's degree in architecture from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1916. Staub was noted for his ability to combine selected elements from historical styles into unique creations that expressed the architect's own sensibilities and the demands of his commissions. His houses are prized for their attention to detail and the thoughtful consideration placed to site location. Staub's homes are generally large, though most eschew ostentation and instead reveal the architect's preference for understated elegance. Staub designed many homes in the prestigious Houston neighborhood of River Oaks. His most famous work is Bayou Bend, a mansion built in 1927 for oil heiress Ima Hogg.

"Bertie the Brain was an early computer game, and one of the first games developed in the early history of video games. It was built in Toronto by Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. The four meter tall computer allowed exhibition attendees to play a game of tic-tac-toe against an artificial intelligence. The player entered a move on a lit keypad in the form of a three-by-three grid, and the game played out on a grid of lights overhead. The machine had an adjustable difficulty level. After two weeks on display by Rogers Majestic, the machine was disassembled at the end of the exhibition and largely forgotten as a curiosity. Kates built the game to showcase his additron tube, a miniature version of the vacuum tube, though the transistor overtook it in computer development shortly thereafter. Patent issues prevented the additron tube from being used in computers besides Bertie before it was no longer useful. Bertie the Brain is a candidate for the first video game, as it was potentially the first computer game to have any sort of visual display of the game. It appeared only three years after the 1947 invention of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game to use an electronic display. Bertie's use of lightbulbs rather than a screen with real-time visual graphics, however, much less moving graphics, does not meet some definitions of a video game.",Work,Software,VideoGame

Murphy largely campaigned on the issue of Irish Water, stating that Sinn Féin could not be trusted to oppose water charges. In the wake of a poor local election result, Labour and Fine Gael were not considered contenders for the seat while Fianna Fáil largely focused its resources on the Roscommon–South Leitrim by-election.

"The Galapagos snake eel (Quassiremus evionthas) is an eel in the family Ophichthidae (worm/snake eels). It was described by David Starr Jordan and Charles Harvey Bollman in 1890.

It dwells at a depth range of 3 to 30 metres (9.8 to 98.4 ft), and inhabits reefs, preferring to live in areas bearing a mixture of boulders, gravel and sand. Males can reach a maximum total length of 71 centimetres (28 in).

"Wild Mouse is the name of a roller coaster at Idlewild and Soak Zone in Ligonier, Pennsylvania. It is the one of two coasters in the park, along with the small classic wooden Rollo Coaster, and its only steel roller coaster. The Wild Mouse was originally designed for Wiener Prater in Vienna, Austria where it operated as Speedy Gonzalez from 1985-1987. Built by Vekoma, it is thus far the only wild mouse coaster designed by this corporation. It was later moved to Alton Towers, an amusement park in Staffordshire, England. When it opened there in 1987, its name was the Alton Mouse. The ride featured a covered lift hill there, which was used to conceal the treacherous curves at the top of the hill from patrons until they reached the top. The lift hill was also tilted, which suggests that the cover was a rotating tunnel, which with the tilting track, created the effect of going upside-down. The Alton Mouse was closed in 1992, partly because the harsh curve and braking system had diminished its popularity, but mainly because the area of the park it was located in was small and the ride was popular, causing congestion. Local residents also complained of the noise levels, so when the Alton Mouse was removed, so were the other rides in the area, which was closed off from the rest of the park. In 1993, the Wild Mouse reopened at Idlewild. The track was originally painted a rust red with black supports when the ride first moved to Idlewild. Rough air brakes continued to hinder the ride until 2002, when a new, much smoother magnetic braking system was installed by Pribonics Technologies and the color scheme was changed to gray track, still with black supports. The Wild Mouse features a traditional setup, including tight, unbanked curves and short but steep hills. However, the ride's height is somewhat taller than that of the average wild mouse coaster and includes a somewhat rougher ride.

"Pickering Airport is a proposed international airport to be built directly north-east of Toronto in Pickering, Ontario, Canada, approximately 65 km (40 mi) east of Toronto Pearson International Airport. Intended to serve the Greater Toronto Area and the Golden Horseshoe, it would be operated by the Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA). In 2004, the estimated cost of building the airport was reported to be approximately $2 billion, and it was anticipated that, by 2032, the airport would be handling up to 11.9 million passengers annually. The Government of Canada's plans for the airport were developed during the late 1960s and early 1970s. A large tract of land in Pickering, Uxbridge, and Markham townships was expropriated for the airport in 1972-1973. Opposition to the project was widespread. Preliminary airport construction activity was halted in 1975 when the provincial partner in the enterprise, the Government of Ontario, declared it would not build the roads or sewers needed to service the site. In 2010, the GTAA completed a Pickering Airport \""Needs Assessment Study\"" commissioned by the federal government. The study's report recommended that the federal government retain the Pickering lands, \""thereby preserving the option of building an airport, if and when required.\"" The Canadian Owners and Pilots Association, an association of private plane owners and pilots, took exception to the methodology and conclusions of the study, arguing that \""the process to implement a new airport at Pickering should be well underway right now.\"" Transport Action Ontario, in its own response to the study report, questioned some of the study's claims and suggested that, in lieu of building a new airport, \""higher-speed, electrified rail\"" would be a \""far superior alternative\"" for much of the short-haul traffic currently handled by Toronto Pearson International. In an announcement in June, 2013, the federal government reaffirmed its intention to hold land on the site for a future airport, stating that the needs assessment study's conclusion was that the airport would be needed within the 2027-2037 time-frame. By July, 2015, the federal government had permanently protected more than half of the farmland and natural habitat on the site by adding it to the Rouge National Urban Park. It announced its intention to use the remainder of the site for economic development, including a potential future airport, but stated that no decisions had been made on development or timing of a potential future airport.",Place,Infrastructure,Airport

"The discography of Hole, a Los Angeles-based American alternative rock band, consists of four studio albums, one compilation album, three extended plays, and twenty-one singles. Hole was formed in 1989 by vocalist and rhythm guitarist Courtney Love and lead guitarist Eric Erlandson. The band went through a number of line-up changes before recruiting bassist Jill Emery and drummer Caroline Rue in early 1990. The band signed to the independent label Caroline Records and its European subsidiary City Slang, and released its debut studio album, Pretty on the Inside, in August 1991. Pretty on the Inside was a critical success, especially in the United Kingdom, where the album's lead single, \""Teenage Whore\"", peaked at number 1 in the UK Indie Chart. Following negotiations with a number of major labels, Hole signed a seven-album DGC Records in 1992. Due to creative differences, Emery and Rue left the band prior to the deal and were replaced by Kristen Pfaff and Patty Schemel, respectively. Hole released its major label debut Live Through This in April 1994. A critical and commercial success, Live Through This was released a week after the death of Love's husband, Kurt Cobain, and two months prior to the death of bassist Kristen Pfaff. The band postponed the album's supporting tour and recruited bassist Melissa Auf der Maur. After constant touring in support of Live Through This's release, Hole went on a hiatus in 1995. In 1998, the band released its third studio album, Celebrity Skin, which debuted at number 9 on the Billboard 200. Following the tour in support of the album, Auf der Maur left the band and joined The Smashing Pumpkins in 2000, and Love and Erlandson disbanded Hole in May 2002. In 2009, Love announced that her second studio album, Nobody's Daughter, was due to be released as Hole's fourth studio album and announced the band's reformation. Although Erlandson claimed that no reformation was possible for legal reasons, Hole released Nobody's Daughter worldwide on April 23, 2010.

"Zagreb bypass (Croatian: obilaznica, zaobilaznica) is a U-shaped motorway partially encircling Zagreb, Croatia. The largest part by far, between Jankomir and Ivanja Reka interchanges, was built between 1977 and 1979, while the Ivanja Reka – Sveta Helena section was built between 1996 and 1999. The bypass is 48.9 kilometres (30.4 mi) long, tracing around the city from the northwestern suburb of Zaprešić to Sveta Helena in the northeast. The bypass crosses the Sava River twice and comprises a bridge across the Sava-Odra floodwater overflow canal. As the busiest sections between Jankomir and Buzin interchanges carry traffic volume of approximately 45,000 AADT, it is the most heavily used motorway sector in Croatia. Zagreb bypass is not designated as a separate motorway with a distinct motorway number, rather it consists of sections of three motorways: Those motorway sections are concurrent with sections of the D1 and D3 state roads as well as European routes E59, E65, E70 and E71. The bypass currently comprises four traffic lanes along its entire length, with an emergency lane in each direction. In its current form, the Zagreb bypass has a small number of interchanges spaced widely apart. For example, the current Zaprešić interchange extends a trip from Zaprešić to Zagreb via the bypass by 4.5 km (2.8 mi). The last new interchange was built in 2007–2008 at Kosnica in the southeast, to connect the Homeland Bridge and Zagreb via Radnička cesta (Ž1029). There are two rest areas along the bypass: Lučko rest area is located between Jankomir and Lučko interchanges comprising famous Plitvice Motel, well known for its pedestrian bridge across the bypass, while Sesvete rest area is located between Popovec and Sveta Helena interchanges.

"The China rockfish (Sebastes nebulosus) is a rockfish of the Pacific coast found from Kachemak Bay in the northern Gulf of Alaska to Redondo Beach and San Nicolas Island in southern California. The China rockfish has a distinctive appearance, with a dark blue or black body crossed by a patchy but obvious yellow stripe that extends from around the third dorsal spine down and then along the lateral line. Although the black-and-yellow rockfish is similar in appearance, the China rockfish has a continuous yellow band while the black-and-yellow has scattered patches of yellow. The body of the China Rockfish may be covered with small whitish or yellowish spots. Maximum reported size is 45 cm (18 inches). Early life history is little-known; juveniles have been observed in shallow coastal water. Adults are solitary and territorial, preferring rocky outcrops with boulder fields and crevices. When confronted with an intruder, the fish erect its spines and try to look larger. The territories are apparently small, with a study off Vancouver Island finding Chinas moving only within 10 m (33 ft). They feed on benthic organisms, including brittle stars, chitons, and crustaceans such as crabs and shrimp. They have been popular for commercial fishing since the 19th century. During the 1930s, Chinas sold for twice as much as any other rockfish except the black-and-yellow rockfish, and for more than any other kind of finfish. They are today popular in Asia, often being sold alive. Commercial fishing methods include hook and line, longline, and trapping. The species epithet nebulosus is Latin for \""clouded\"". Although Jordan and Evermann promoted the common name \""yellowspotted rockfish\"", the \""China\"" name has persisted, due to a perceived preference by persons of Chinese ancestry living in central California. The species was actually described by both W. O. Ayres and Charles Frédéric Girard in the same year, with Girard naming the species S. fasciatus, but the name had already been used for the Acadian redfish and thus Ayres' choice prevailed.",Species,Animal,Fish

"The rhyming spiritual is a religious genre of music found in the Bahamas, and also the songs, usually spirituals, and vocal-style within that genre. Rhyming does not refer to rhyme but to verse, the rhymer, or lead-singer, singing the couplets of the verses against the sung background of the repeated chorus. Rhyming was most popular during the sponge fishing of the 1930s (the sponges having been killed by a fungus), and Peter Elliot is considered the best rhymer. Generally songs are structured verse-chorus-verse form, where the chorus is the goal of the verse, but in a rhyming spiritual the chorus becomes the accompaniment to the verse. The verse progresses over the chorus and eventually coincides, often with the rhymer dropping out for the last few words of the chorus. Usually there are three voices which make up the songs,the rhymer doing the melody, the Basser which does a very low tone accompaniment, and the falsetto performing high pitches.",TopicalConcept,Genre,MusicGenre

The Z16 and Z18 engines used a shorter block similar to the earlier L13/L14/L16/L18 variants. All Z engines were SOHC. The most notable feature of the Z-series engine was the change from the L series head, to a crossflow cylinder head which reduced emissions by moving the intake ports to the right side of the engine opposite the exhaust ports. This change allows the exhaust port velocity to more effectively scavenge the cylinder and reduce reversion pulses to enhance induction.

"The winghead shark (Eusphyra blochii) is a species of hammerhead shark, and part of the family Sphyrnidae. Reaching a length of 1.9 m (6.2 ft), this small brown to gray shark has a slender body with a tall, sickle-shaped first dorsal fin. Its name comes from its exceptionally large \""hammer\"", or cephalofoil, which can be as wide as half of the shark's total length. The function of this structure is unclear but may relate to the shark's senses. The wide spacing of its eyes grants superb binocular vision, while the extremely long nostrils on the leading margin of the cephalofoil may allow for better detection and tracking of odor trails in the water. The cephalofoil also provides a large surface area for its ampullae of Lorenzini and lateral line, with potential benefits for electroreception and mechanoreception respectively. Inhabiting the shallow coastal waters of the western Indo-Pacific, the winghead shark feeds on small bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. It gives birth to live young, with the developing embryos receiving nourishment through a placental connection. Females produce annual litters of 6–25 pups; depending on region, birthing may occur from February to June after a gestation period of 8–11 months. This harmless species is widely fished for meat, fins, liver oil, and fishmeal. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Endangered in 2016, as it is thought to have declined in some parts of its range due to over-exploitation.",Species,Animal,Fish

His teacher influenced him in his preference for the architecture of the Italian Renaissance. Cluysenaer had a talent for business. He took the initiative for some very profitable real estate projects - such as the Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert in Brussels - in which he played the double role of architect and co-financier.He also had a good reputation amongst the Belgian nobility and high bourgeoisie.

"Rushford Lake is a small reservoir in the western part of New York, United States. The lake is in the northwest part of Allegany County, New York, mostly in the Town of Rushford, but the eastern part of the lake is in the Town of Caneadea. The lake has a crescent shape. Rush Creek feeds into the south end of the lake and an outlet on the east side feeds into the Genesee River. The maximum depth is 120 feet (37 m). Rushford lake was formed by a dam on Caneadea Creek in 1927, resulting in the loss of the communities of East Rushford and Kellogville by flooding. The dam and resulting lake were originally owned and governed by Rochester Gas and Electric (RG&E) for the purpose to control the water level in the Genesee River. In 1981 the dam and Rushford Lake was transferred to the Rushford Lake Recreation District which manages the dam, as well as lake and shoreline use. The angling public has access to the lake at two points. On the north side of the lake, the Balcom Beach area provides shore fishing access and a trailered boat launch. Launching for boats engaged in fishing only is free, seven days a week. Near the dam, an area off Dam Road provides shore fishing access. Rushford Lake is 585 acres (2.37 km2) in size. The lake is drawn down 40 feet (12 m) each winter and ice fishing is not allowed. The communities of Balcom Beach (northern shore) and Hillcrest (western shore) are located near the lake. New York State Route 243 passes the northern end of the lake. The lake is largely a recreational lake during the summer months.It is also stocked yearly with brown and rainbow trout in the spring for quality fishing by the NYS DEC. Bass, crappie, carp, perch, suckers, bullhead and sunfish are also part of this fishery. Rushford Lake is the setting of the 2004 movie Ghost Lake. In the film, the souls of village residents who drowned after the dam's construction return one hundred years later to avenge their death.

"Brading Down is a chalk down southwest of Brading, Isle of Wight. It is a prominent hill which overlooks Sandown Bay, with spectacular views across the bay towards Shanklin, and Culver Down. It is a Local Nature Reserve. Parts of the down are private, including an area used as a covered reservoir, and some for agriculture. But much of the down, some 35 hectares (86 acres), is open to the public and is owned by the Isle of Wight Council. The main area of Brading Down is fenced and grazed but access on foot and for horse riders is available from the many pathways entering the area, and the car parks bordering the main Newport to Brading Road. The thin chalk soils to the east of the site support a typical downland plant community with pyramidal orchids being a particular feature in the summer. In recent years a programme of scrub clearance has been undertaken. The area is good for butterflies including common blue, chalkhill blue, small, large and dingy skippers, marbled white, gatekeeper, and meadow brown. In addition to the wildlife interest of chalk downland, the ancient field system on Brading Down is a Scheduled Monument. The finest surviving ancient field system on the Island is to be found on the down. This is likely to be of late Iron Age or Roman date and highlights the last time the fields were ploughed.

"Mycena is a large genus of small saprotrophic mushrooms that are rarely more than a few centimeters in width. They are characterized by a white spore print, a small conical or bell-shaped cap, and a thin fragile stem. Most are gray or brown, but a few species have brighter colors. Most have a translucent and striate cap, which rarely has an incurved margin. The gills are attached and usually have cystidia. Some species, like Mycena haematopus, exude a latex when the stem is broken, and many have the odor of bleach. Mycenas are hard to identify to species and some are distinguishable only by microscopic features such as the shape of the cystidia. Some species are edible, while others contain toxins, but the edibility of most is not known, as they are too small to be useful in cooking. Mycena cyanorrhiza stains blue and contains the hallucinogen psilocybin and Mycena pura contains the mycotoxin muscarine. Over 33 species are known to be bioluminescent, creating a glow known as foxfire. These species are divided among 16 lineages, leading to evolutionary uncertainty in whether the luminescence developed once and was lost among many species, or evolved in parallel by several species. What, if any, benefit the fungus derives from the luminescence is uncertain. Alexander Smith's 1947 Mycena monograph identified 232 species; the genus is now known to include about 500 species worldwide. Maas Geesteranus divided the genus into 38 sections in 1992, providing keys to each for all the species of the Northern Hemisphere. Many new species have been discovered since then, and four new sections have been proposed. Taxonomy is complex, as most sections are not truly homogeneous, and the keys fail for some species, especially those that satisfy some criteria for only part of their life cycle. Some sections contain only one species. The name Mycena comes from the Ancient Greek μύκης, meaning mushroom. Species in the genus Mycena (and in Hemimycena) are commonly known as bonnets.",Species,Eukaryote,Fungus

"Nina Grewal, MP (born October 20, 1958), is a Canadian politician of the Conservative Party. She represented the constituency of Fleetwood—Port Kells, British Columbia from her election in the 2004 federal election to her defeat in the 2015 federal election by Liberal MP Ken Hardie. Grewal was born in Osaka, Japan in 1958. She and her husband lived in Liberia before emigrating to Canada, where she raised her young family while working as a sales manager selling Registered Education Savings Plans. Grewal became an active member of the community and the Reform Party of Canada (subsequently the Canadian Alliance and Conservative Party of Canada), participating in many national and regional conferences and conventions. She is married to former Member of Parliament Gurmant Grewal, and the Grewals were the first married couple in Canadian history to concurrently serve as federal MPs. Grewal is a member of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Sub-Committee on International Human Rights, and she has served on the Immigration, Canadian Heritage, and Status of Women committees. During her first term, she introduced a private members motion seeking to raise the age of consent. While the then-Liberal government defeated the measure, the subsequent Conservative government put it into law. She also proposed measures to tackle identity theft (with Bill C-271) and to amend the State Immunity Act (Bill C-346), both of which were incorporated into government legislation and subsequently passed. In addition, she pursued bills against child pornography (Bill C-347) and regulations for the volume of television commercials (Bill C-621). The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission later decided to implement her proposals entirely. From May 15–18, 2005, Grewal's husband surreptitiously taped his discussions with the Liberal Party in which he was enticed by the Liberal government officials to crossing the floor to the Liberals in exchange for patronage positions. The Liberals were concerned with saving the government during the vote of confidence, and had also contacted MPs Chuck Cadman, Inky Mark, and Belinda Stronach (the last of whom did cross the floor, and was made an instant minister). When the audio tapes were released, Nina Grewal publicly refused to comment about these discussions but the Grewals had explained in detail to the Parliamentary Ethics Commissioner about the discussions on May 16. On November 29, 2006, it was announced that Nina Grewal would be standing for re-election, even though her husband was not. She successfully defended her seat in the 2006, 2008, and 2011 federal elections, but lost in the 2015 election. Grewal announced her support for Motion 312, a motion that would have Canada reexamine their definition of when human life begins.",Agent,Politician,MemberOfParliament

"Ronald \""Ron\"" Staniforth (13 April 1924 – October 1988) was an English footballer, described as a tall, cultured full-back. His attacking excursions down the right wing sometimes caused concern to his team's supporters but probably more to his opponents. After service in the Royal Navy during the war he became a milkman and played in local league football, signing professional for Stockport County at the relatively late age of 22. When the Stockport manager Andy Beattie moved to Huddersfield Town in the 1952 close season, Staniforth followed. Huddersfield had just been relegated. Staniforth, together with all the remainder of the defence, played in every game in the following season in which Huddersfield finished in second place and so were promoted back to the First Division. In their first season back, Huddersfield maintained their momentum and were challenging for the championship. This led to Staniforth playing three times for England 'B' and then gaining eight England caps, all in 1954, including three in the final stages of the World Cup. He was also in the England side which notoriously lost 7–1 to Hungary although this did not lead to his losing his place. In 1955 Huddersfield were becoming concerned about the ageing profile of their team and Staniforth was dropped after being given the run-around by Bobby Mitchell in a quarter-final of the F.A. Cup. In July 1955 he moved to Sheffield Wednesday, along with Roy Shiner, in an exchange deal which brought Tony Conwell and Jackie Marriott to Huddersfield (they were respectively eight and four years younger). At the age of 31, however, Staniforth's career was far from over. It must have seemed like déjà vu. Like his arrival at Huddersfield, Wednesday had just been relegated from the First Division and were promoted in his first season. Also he teamed up again with former Huddersfield defender Don McEvoy. He went on to make 102 appearances for Wednesday over four seasons, during which they were promoted twice and relegated once. In October 1959 he moved to Barrow as player-manager, later to be joined by McEvoy as a player. He retired from playing after 38 games and resigned as manager in 1964. Later he had two spells on the coaching staff at Hillsborough. He died in Barrow in October 1988, aged 64.",Agent,SportsManager,SoccerManager

"Equisetum telmateia (great horsetail or northern giant horsetail) is a species of Equisetum (horsetail) with an unusual distribution, with one subspecies native to Europe, western Asia and northwest Africa, and a second subspecies native to western North America. The North American subspecies is often simply but ambiguously called \""giant horsetail\"", but that name may just as well refer to the Latin American Equisetum giganteum and Equisetum myriochaetum. It is a herbaceous perennial plant, with separate green photosynthetic sterile stems, and pale yellowish non-photosynthetic spore-bearing fertile stems. The sterile stems, produced in late spring and dying down in late autumn, are 30–150 cm (rarely to 240 cm) tall (the tallest species of horsetail outside of tropical regions) and 1 cm diameter, heavily branched, with whorls of 14–40 branches, these up to 20 cm long, 1–2 mm diameter and unbranched, emerging from the axils of a ring of bracts. The fertile stems are produced in early spring before the sterile shoots, growing to 15–45 cm tall with an apical spore-bearing strobilus 4–10 cm long and 1–2 cm broad, and no side branches; the spores disperse in mid spring, with the fertile stems dying immediately after spore release. It also spreads by means of rhizomes that have been observed to penetrate 4 meters into wet clay soil, spreading laterally in multiple layers. Occasional plants produce stems that are both fertile and photosynthetic. It is found in damp shady places, spring fens and seepage lines, usually in open woodlands, commonly forming large clonal colonies. There are two subspecies: \n* Equisetum telmateia subsp. telmateia.

A PlayStation 3 version was originally announced, but was never released. The game is set in a fictional world divided into multiple city-states inhabited by four different species and whose past includes conflicts over \""Remnants,\"" magical artifacts of varying forms. The player takes the role of Rush Sykes, a young man searching for his sister that becomes entangled in a secret war. It features a unique battle system in which the player command multiple groups, or \""unions\"", of characters rather than individual units. The game was directed by Hiroshi Takai and was the first game developed by Square Enix to use the Unreal Engine 3. It was intended by Square Enix president Yoichi Wada to \""become a cornerstone for [their] worldwide strategy\"". Art direction was overseen by chief artist Kimihiko Miyamae and art producer Yusuke Naora. The game's soundtrack was composed by Tsuyoshi Sekito with assistance by Yasuhiro Yamanaka. It was later released as a three-disc album. The design and dialogue of the game were created to appeal to international players as well as Japanese players, and the motion capture for the main characters, including the lip-syncing, was done with Western, English-speaking actors. The game received a weak reception by reviewers, though it was better received by Japanese reviewers than by Western ones. A common complaint, especially in the original Xbox 360 release, was of graphical problems including low framerates and \""texture pop-in\"" where higher resolution textures would suddenly replace lower ones several seconds after a scene had started.

"Circle Drive Bridge spans the South Saskatchewan River in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. It is a steel girder bridge, built in 1983 as part of the Circle Drive freeway system in northeast Saskatoon. At the time of construction, it cost $11.8 million to build. It is the northernmost bridge in the city. As with other bridges in the city, locals use several different names for this bridge. During construction there was an unsuccessful campaign to have it named after recently deceased former Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. Longtime Saskatonians also refer to it as the 42nd Street Bridge, a reference to a former name of the northern east-west leg of Circle Drive dating back to the 1960s; this name was also commonly applied to the bridge in media coverage and city council references to its planning and construction dating back to the early 1960s. In recent years, Saskatonians began referring to it as the Circle Drive North Bridge. The Circle Drive Bridge is a twin-span bridge; it was designed so that more lanes could be added by filling in the centre. Early published plans for the bridge called for the addition of an observation deck/interpretive centre to the underside of the bridge at that point. However, rather than widening the bridge by filling in the centre gap, it was deemed to be more cost effective to convert the outside pedestrian walkways into driving lanes. In 2006, construction started on adding a third outside lane in both directions to increase capacity and ease congestion during peak traffic times. The lane additions were completed in 2007. A new pedestrian walkway was built below and between the two bridge structures, and opened in July 2007. The walkway was dedicated as the Stew Uzelman Pedway on October 31, 2009. The bridge was the scene of a notable accident on 30 December 2013, when Breanna Pegg lost control of her car after hitting ice on the bridge. Her car went over built-up snow along the guard rail, which launched the vehicle up and over the side of the bridge. It crashed onto the frozen river below and started to sink through the broken ice.

"The Columbia River Crossing (CRC) was a joint freeway megaproject from 2005 to 2013 between Oregon and Washington, which proposed to widen and modernize Interstate 5 where it crossed the Columbia River. Central to this was the replacement of the Interstate Bridge, a pair of through-truss bridges. The northbound bridge dates to 1917, and its nearly identical companion was opened in 1958 to carry southbound traffic. The bridges, the earlier of which pre-dates the U.S. Highway System by nine years, served as the crossing for U.S. Route 99 before the establishment of the Interstate Highway System and Interstate 5 as the new route number. Each of the current bridges currently has three traffic lanes and no emergency lanes. Each bridge also has a vertical-lift draw bridge span on the Washington State side of the river to allow shipping traffic access upriver. The CRC was intended to be a safer, more modern bridge, with greater capacity, including light rail to directly connect with the regional MAX system. It would also have replaced or modified seven freeway interchanges south of SR-500. \""Project partners\"" included the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit Administration, cities of Vancouver and Portland, the Southwest Washington Regional Transportation Council, Metro, and transit agencies C-Tran and TriMet. Other agencies were involved as part of \""task forces,\"" but the project was blocked July 2013 by Republican opposition within the Washington State Senate.",Place,RouteOfTransportation,Bridge
"Albert Cornelius Besselink (born June 30, 1922) is an American professional golfer who played on the PGA Tour in the 1950s and 1960s. Besselink grew up in Merchantville, New Jersey. He attended the University of Miami and was the first UM golfer to win a national tournament. He won the Southern Invitational Championship twice before graduating in 1949. He turned pro later that year. Besselink won five PGA Tour events including the inaugural Tournament of Champions in 1953. The field was made up of 20 professionals, all tournament winners in the prior twelve months. With a six-foot par putt on the 18th hole, he finished with a 280, beating Chandler Harper by one stroke. Besselink was paid off with a wheelbarrow filled with silver dollars. He also had bet $500 on himself at 25 to 1, earning another $12,500. Because he had just heard that Babe Zaharias had been diagnosed with cancer he donated half of his $10,000 first prize to the Damon Runyon Cancer Fund. Besselink and Zaharias had won the International Two-Ball Championship at Orlando in February 1952. He was called \""Bessie\"" by the other tour players and was known for living life with a gambler's recklessness and a showman's flair. One famous example of his showmanship occurred during the third round of the 1965 Colonial Invitational in Fort Worth when Besselink played the final four holes of his third round with a red rose—plucked from a bush at the 15th hole—between his teeth. Afterward, Besselink said the gesture was a nod to the \""loveliness of Texas women in general and Fort Worth women in particular.\"" The next day, locker room attendants presented Besselink with 50 roses sent by female fans.",Agent,Athlete,GolfPlayer

In 1958 he was a candidate for the Presidency of Mexico. He has also served as Mayor of Chihuahua, president of his party and was the coordinator of the dialogues for peace in Chiapas. Luis Héctor Álvarez dedicated most of his life to the textile industry. He first became involved in politics in Ciudad Juárez. In 1956 the PAN nominated him as candidate to Governor of Chihuahua. He lost the election to PRI candidate Teófilo Borunda. After the election an electoral fraud was claimed by Álvarez and his party. In an act of civil disobedience, Alvarez headed a caravan from Chihuahua to Mexico City.In 1958, he ran as the PAN candidate in the federal election against Adolfo López Mateos where he lost. In the following years Álvarez dedicated himself mainly to his private enterprise, until 1983 when he was elected Municipal President of Chihuahua. Being an opposition figure, Álvarez constantly clashed with the state and federal governments. Álvarez claimed he was not given the proper legal resources and participation in his citys decisions. In protest, Álvarez started a hunger strike that lasted 40 days. The strike also contested the 1986 elections in Chihuahua in which opposition parties claimed an electoral fraud had taken place once again. In 1987 he was elected 14th president of the PAN party and in 1990 he won the re-election.His tenure as president of the party is controversial. His supporters claim that during his administration the party became the strongest opposition force in Mexican politics. His detractors on the other hand claim that his party strayed away from its original doctrine and was now run by the “neo-panistas” (e.g. Manuel Clouthier, Vicente Fox, Francisco Barrio Terrazas and Ernesto Ruffo Appel). Prominent party members, including Pablo Emilio Madero, Jesus González Schmal, Jose González Torres and Bernardo Bátiz, left the PAN in protest arguing that Álvarez's policy of dialogue with Carlos Salinas de Gortari legitimized his government which was under intense national criticism of perpetrating an electoral fraud. He was elected to the Senate for Chihuahua from 1994 to 2000, during which period he served as a member of the Commission of Concord and Pacification in Chiapas that was in charge of the peace negotiation between the Federal Government and the Zapatista Army of National Liberation. In 2000, President Vicente Fox designated him Coordinator of the Dialogue for La Paz in Chiapas.During this time he never was able to contact the leadership of the EZLN.

"Elections were held in the Australian state of Queensland on 13 June 1998 to elect the 89 members of the state's Legislative Assembly. The result of the election was a second consecutive hung parliament, with the Australian Labor Party forming minority government after receiving the support of independent Peter Wellington. This election was the first in which One Nation supporters were elected into state Parliament, with the controversial party winning 11 seats. With nearly 23% of the vote, One Nation gained a higher percentage of the vote than any other third party (non-Labor or Coalition) at the state or territory level since Federation. This was also the only election where a third party has gained more votes than both the Liberal and National parties (considered separately). No attempt was made to calculate a two-party vote, unlike in past elections; the One Nation vote was so high that any 2PP result would have been meaningless. A few months after the election, the One Nation member for Mulgrave, Charles Rappolt resigned. Labor won the ensuing by-election, allowing it to form government with a bare majority of 45 seats. The fact that the Coalition Government came to office as a direct result of the 1996 Mundingburra by-election instead of the general election the previous year, as well as its failure to win in its own right at the 1998 election meant that the 1998 election was the fourth consecutive election victory for the Queensland ALP, which had won every election since 1989.",Event,SocietalEvent,Election

"Chamaecyparis, common names cypress or false cypress (to distinguish it from related cypresses), is a genus of conifers in the cypress family Cupressaceae, native to eastern Asia (Japan + Taiwan) and to the western and eastern margins of the United States. The name is derived from the Greek khamai, meaning ground, and kuparissos for cypress. They are medium-sized to large evergreen trees growing from 20–70 m (66–230 ft) tall, with foliage in flat sprays. The leaves are of two types, needle-like juvenile leaves on young seedlings up to a year old, and scale-like adult leaves.

The battle ended with the capture of the British post ship Ariel by Amazone. On 11 September 1779, whilst the Ariel was cruising off Charles Town under Captain Thomas Mackenzie, she sighted a strange sail and approached to investigate, unaware that a French fleet under the Admiral comte d'Estaing had entered the theatre from the West Indies. As Mackenzie got closer he realized that the stranger was actually a frigate, accompanied by two brigs and a schooner, and that she was not responding to his signals, he had to retreat for the Georgia shore. The frigate gradually overhauled Ariel and Mackenzie was forced to stand and fight. The enemy vessel was the 36-gun French Amazone. After a ninety-minute flight in which lost her mizzen-mast and all her rigging and sustained casualties of four men dead and another 20 wounded, Mackenzie surrendered Ariel. d'Estaing immediately exchanged the crew of Ariel and Experiment, which he had captured the year before, for French prisoners. The crews of these two vessels then went to man a variety of British vessels on the North America Station. The French took the captured ship into service as Ariel.

In his 21-season tenure with the New Jersey Devils, he won three Stanley Cup championships and five Eastern Conference titles in 17 postseason campaigns. He also won two Olympic gold medals with Team Canada in the 2002 and 2010 Winter Olympic Games, as well as several other medals with Team Canada in other international competitions. Brodeur is widely regarded as one of the greatest goaltenders of all time. Brodeur holds numerous NHL and franchise records, including all-time regular season wins (691), losses (397), shutouts (125), and games played (1,266). He won at least 30 games in twelve straight seasons between 1995–96 and 2007–08 and is the only goalie in NHL history with eight 40-win seasons. He is a four-time Vezina Trophy winner, a five-time Jennings Trophy winner, a ten-time NHL All-Star, a Calder Memorial Trophy winner, and one of only two NHL goaltenders to score a goal in both the regular season and the playoffs. Brodeur used a hybrid style of goaltending by standing up more than butterfly style goalies, though he adapted to more modern techniques at the latter stage of his career. He was known for his puck handling, his positional play, and his reflexes, especially with his glove hand. Brodeur's prowess at puck handling was so notorious that it led in part to the NHL changing its rules regarding where goalies were allowed to handle the puck outside of the goal crease, leading to its moniker of \""The Brodeur Rule\"".

"The Church of St Mary, Studley Royal, is a Victorian Gothic Revival church built in the Early English style by William Burges. It is located in the grounds of Studley Royal Park at Fountains Abbey, in North Yorkshire, England. Burges was commissioned by the First Marquess of Ripon to build the church as a memorial church to Frederick Grantham Vyner, his brother in law. It is one of two such churches, the other being the Church of Christ the Consoler at Skelton-on-Ure. Frederick Vyner had been murdered by Greek bandits in 1870. A significant ransom had been demanded, and in part collected, before his death. His mother, Lady Mary Vyner, and his sister, Lady Ripon, used the unspent ransom to build the two churches in his memory. Burges' appointment as architect was most likely due to the connection between his greatest patron, John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute, and Vyner, who had been friends at Oxford. St Mary's, was commissioned in 1870 and work began in 1871. The church was consecrated in 1878. As at Skelton, Burges' design demonstrates a move from his favoured Early-French, to an English style.

"US Highway 31 (US 31) is a part of the United States Numbered Highway System that runs from Alabama to the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. In Michigan, it is a state trunkline highway that runs from the Indiana–Michigan state line at Bertrand Township north to its terminus at Interstate 75 (I-75) south of Mackinaw City. Along its 356.5-mile-long (573.7 km) route, US 31 follows the Michigan section of the St. Joseph Valley Parkway as well as other freeways and divided highways northward to Ludington. North of there, the trunkline is a rural undivided highway through the Northern Michigan tourist destinations of Traverse City and Petoskey before terminating south of Mackinaw City. Along its route, US 31 has been dedicated in memory of a few different organizations, and sections of it carry the Lake Michigan Circle Tour (LMCT) moniker. Four bridges used by the highway have been recognized for their historic character as well. The first highways along the route of the modern US 31 corridor were the West Michigan Pike, an auto trail from 1913, and later a pair of state trunklines (the original M-11 and M-58) in 1919. These state highways were redesignated US 31 on November 11, 1926, when the US Highway System was approved. Since then, the highway has been realigned in places. The highway crossed the Straits of Mackinac by ferry for about a decade in the 1920s and 1930s before the Mackinac Bridge was built, connecting to US 2 north of St. Ignace. Later, sections were converted into freeways starting in the 1950s. These segments opened through the subsequent decades with the last one opening in 2003.

Born in Natoma, California, he was listed as 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 m) tall and 175 pounds (79 kg). Briggs initially signed with his hometown team, the Sacramento Solons of the Open-Classification Pacific Coast League, in 1952. In 1954, he led the Class A Western International League in strikeouts (233) and earned run average (2.50) and won 20 of 28 decisions as a member of the Salem Senators. After two three-game trials with the Cubs in 1956 and 1957, he rejoined the Cubs in the midst of the 1958 campaign and took a spot in their starting rotation. He split ten decisions in 20 games pitched (with 17 starts) and put up an ERA of 4.52. He threw what would be his only MLB shutout on June 24, scattering eight hits and four bases on balls to defeat the Philadelphia Phillies, 3–0. In January 1959 Briggs was sent to the Indians in a waiver deal that also featured outfielder Jim Bolger, pitcher Morrie Martin and utilityman Earl Averill, Jr. Although he pitched effectively in three spring appearances for Cleveland, Briggs spent most of the 1959 season in Triple-A with the San Diego Padres, where he went 14–6 (2.60). That led to Briggs's only full season of Major League experience, 1960. He worked in 21 games for the Indians, all but two of them as a relief pitcher, and compiled a 4–2 mark with one save. His contract then was sold to the Athletics on July 30. But Briggs treated roughly in his first five appearances for Kansas City, allowing 14 hits, seven bases on balls and 13 earned runs in seven innings pitched. During that skein, he lost his only starting assignment to the Boston Red Sox on August 4, failing to record an out and allowing a three-run, first-inning home run to veteran Vic Wertz. Briggs finished the 1960 season 4–4 with a 6.42 earned run average. The following winter, he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds with fellow right-hander John Tsitouris for veteran southpaw pitcher Joe Nuxhall. Briggs never appeared in regular season game for Cincinnati, playing two more years of Triple-A before his 1962 retirement.

"Francis Parker Yockey (September 18, 1917 – June 16, 1960) was an American attorney, political philosopher and polemicist best known for his neo-Spenglerian book Imperium: The Philosophy of History and Politics, published under the pen name Ulick Varange in 1948. This book argues for a culture-based, totalitarian path for the preservation of Western culture. Yockey actively supported many far-right causes around the world and remains one of the seminal influences of many White nationalist and New Right movements. Although he was a devotee of Oswald Spengler (who was critical of the Nazis), Yockey was a passionate proponent of antisemitism, and expressed a reverence for German National Socialism, and a general affinity for fascist causes. Yockey contacted or worked with the Nazi aligned Silver Shirts and the German-American Bund. After the defeat of the Axis in the Second World War, Yockey became even more active in neo-Fascist causes. Yockey believed that the United States was an engine of liberalism, controlled by Zionist Jews. Yockey also met Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, and wrote anti-Zionist propaganda on behalf of the Egyptian government, seeing the pan-Arab nationalist movement as another ally to challenge \""the Jewish-American power.\"" While in prison for falsified passports, he was visited by American right-winger Willis Carto, who ultimately became the chief advocate and publisher of Yockey's writings.",Agent,Person,Philosopher

The engine was intended to power the TVR Griffith and the TVR Chimaera but delays in its production meant that it powered only the TVR Cerbera and the TVR Tuscan Racer. The reason behind the engine's development and production was that in that particular time Rover was bought by BMW and Peter Wheeler the boss of TVR in that time, feared that BMW would drop the Rover V8 engine used in TVRs since the early 80's, so he contracted car engine designer Al Melling to design a brand-new V8 engine to power the TVR Cerbera as well as an engine that TVR could sell to other car manufacturers. The engine itself was designed by engine guru Al Melling along with John Ravenscroft and the then boss of TVR Peter Wheeler. Its production codename was \""AJP8\"" (A=Al, J=John, P=Peter), with this naming convention being subsequently used by the Speed Six engine's \""AJP6\"" codename. The Speed Eight featured many aspects found in a racing engine, such as a flat plane crankshaft, a 75-degree Vee angle, a SOHC arrangement operating two valves per cylinder and sequential fuel injection. There were two versions of the Speed Eight engine, one displacing 4.2L and producing 360 bhp (270 kW), and the other displacing 4.5L and producing 420 bhp (310 kW). Beyond that, a Red Rose conversion was made available that increased output to 440 bhp (330 kW) when using fuel with a minimum octane rating of 97 RON. The Red Rose upgrade included reshaped intake and exhaust ports, higher compression, and an ECU that can be switched between two sets of fueling and ignition maps (for 95 RON and 97 RON fuel, respectively). The Speed Eight engine has a high specific output for a normally aspirated engine with 83.3 bhp/L for the 4.2L, 93.3 bhp/L for the 4.5L, and 97.7 bhp/L for the Red Rose-specification 4.5L engine. Another notable aspect is the weight of the engine, which is 267 lb (121 kg) dry. Even though the engine was a strong seller in the Speed Eight Cerbera, TVR dropped it when they stopped production of the Cerbera in 2003. (A special anniversary Cerbera made in 2006 to celebrate the car used the 4.5L version of the engine.) In recent news though, Al Melling is planning to produce a new sports car called the Melling Wildcat which will be powered by an improved 4.7 litre 460 bhp (340 kW) version of the AJP8.",Device,Engine,AutomobileEngine

He was bred by Robert Sangster's Swettenham Stud and purchased by the French racing operation Mise de Moratalla, who named him for a famous Parlement of Paris known as the Lit de justice. The colt was sired by El Gran Senor, who was an outstanding son of Northern Dancer and earned Irish and English Champion honours at age two in 1983 and at three in 1984. He was out of the mare Kanmary, whose sire Kenmare was a French Group One winner and the Leading sire in France in 1988 and 1989. Trained by Alain de Royer-Dupre to run on European turf courses, Lit de Justice began racing at age two. On August 1, 1992, he finished fourth in his debut at Deauville-La Touques Racecourse. Winless at ages two and three, Lit de Justice got his first victory in his thirteenth start on June 4, 1994, in the Prix Durbar at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse. He made one more winless start in France before being sold on July 17, 1994, to Carol and Cornelius Ray's Evergreen Farm located near Paris, Kentucky.

However, the generic name was preoccupied, already in use, by a genus of beetle, Protognathus Basilewsky 1950.

"4358 Lynn, provisional designation A909 TF, is a stony Eunomia asteroid from the middle region of the asteroid belt, approximately 10 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by British astronomer Philip Herbert Cowell at the Royal Greenwich Observatory on 5 October 1909. The asteroid is a member of the Eunomia family, a large group of S-type asteroids and the most prominent family in the intermediate main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.2–3.1 AU once every 4 years and 3 months (1,536 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.17 and an inclination of 13° with respect to the ecliptic. No precoveries or identifications were made prior to its discovery, and the asteroid's observation arc begins in 1909. According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid measures 9.1 kilometers in diameter and its surface has a high albedo of 0.307. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for members of the Eunomia family of 0.21 and calculates a diameter of 10.5 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 12.2. A rotational light-curve was obtained for this asteroid from photometric observations made at the Australian Oakley Southern Sky Observatory (E09) in April 2009. The light-curve gave a well-defined rotation period of 3.8377±0.0006 hours with a brightness variation of 0.60 in magnitude (U=3). The minor planet is named for William Thynne Lynn (1835–1911), who worked for many years as an assistant at the Royal Greenwich Observatory during the second half of the 19th century. He was also an author of various well received books and many short notes on astronomical topics, which were printed in The Observatory.

"Hugh Trumble (12 May 1867 – 14 August 1938) was an Australian cricketer who played 32 Test matches as a bowling all-rounder between 1890 and 1904. He captained the Australian team in two Tests, winning both. Trumble took 141 wickets in Test cricket—a world record at the time of his retirement—at an average of 21.78 runs per wicket. He is one of only four bowlers to twice take a hat-trick in Test cricket. Observers in Trumble's day, including the authoritative Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, regarded him as ranking among the great Australian bowlers of the Golden Age of cricket. He was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1897 and the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame, established in 1996, inducted him in 2004. A tall and thin off spinner, Trumble delivered the ball at a quicker pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage. He was at his best on the softer pitches of England, but his accuracy and variations in pace enabled him to take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia. He was a dependable lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips. He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, with a penchant for practical jokes. Trumble made his Test debut during the Australian cricket team's tour of England in 1890, but was unable to secure a permanent place in the Australian side until the 1896 tour of England. When the Australian team next toured England in 1899, Trumble scored 1,183 runs and took 142 wickets; only George Giffen before him had achieved the \""double\"" of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets as part of a touring team in England. He was appointed captain of Australia in 1901–02, when Joe Darling was unavailable due to farming commitments. He retired after the 1902 Australian tour of England but was coaxed back in 1903–04. In his last Test match, Trumble took a hat-trick, his second, in front of his home town supporters in Melbourne. Off the field, Trumble worked for the National Bank of Australasia, rising to the position of manager of a local branch despite his cricket commitments interrupting his banking career. In 1911, he was appointed secretary of the Melbourne Cricket Club, overseeing the development of the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) into a stadium capable of holding over 70,000 spectators.

"Nageia nagi, whose common name is Asian bayberry, is in the family Podocarpaceae named by Carl Peter Thunberg. Nageia nagi is native to China, Japan, and Taiwan. It is a hardy tree species, which means that it can withstand a range of weather conditions, but prefers moist sites that are well draining and full sunlight to light shade. Being from the Podocarpaceae family, Nageia nagi is a dioecious tree. Dioecious is when the male and female parts of the trees are on separate plants. The pollen cones are catkins and the female cones, which mature in one year, are reduced fleshy bracts that contains a single inverted ovule. It requires the wind for pollination, it cannot self-pollinate. Nageia nagi has an average height to fifteen to twenty meters tall and it is relatively slow growing. The leaves are a glossy lancolate shape, they arrange themselves sub opposite on the branches. They range from two to eight inches long and 0.75 to 2.5 inches wide and lack a mid-vein, the principle vein in the middle of the leaf. The new leaves are a light green and as they age they become dark green and glossy. The branches also start out as green but as they age they become reddish brown and peel in small layers. Houses, bridges, utensils, handiwork and furniture are constructed from the wood of this species and the seeds yield an oil that is eatable and valued in industry. The leaves are also eatable but are not valued in industry for that purpose. Nageia nagi can be propagated by cuttings or by seed. It is best to plant the seed in a warm greenhouse and sandy soil. For their permanent position, they should be planted in late spring or early summer after the last frost. It is threatened by habitat loss. Formerly called Myrica Nagi, its bark exhibits strong antibacterial effect.(2)",Species,Plant,Conifer

"Quantity of Books v. Kansas, 378 U.S. 205 (1964), is an in rem United States Supreme Court decision on First Amendment questions relating to the forfeiture of obscene material. By a 7–2 margin, the Court held that a seizure of the books was unconstitutional, since no hearing had been held on whether the books were obscene, and it reversed a Kansas Supreme Court decision that upheld the seizure. The case arose several years earlier when police in Junction City, Kansas raided an adult bookstore. The state's Attorney General, William M. Ferguson, had previously filed an information with the county court listing 51 titles published by Nightstand Books as allegedly obscene; at the bookstore, 31 of those titles found and 1,175 were seized. These procedures were believed to be in keeping with the Supreme Court's recent Marcus v. Search Warrant decision, which held that some sort of judicial review was necessary to determine if seized material was obscene prior to seizure. Justice William Brennan wrote for a four-justice plurality that considered the case strictly on procedural grounds, without reaching the question of the books' obscenity. It could, he said, operate as a form of prior restraint. In one of two separate concurrences, Justice Hugo Black reaffirmed his earlier blanket opposition to all legal suppression of obscenity, in which he was joined by William O. Douglas. Justice Potter Stewart said that the books in question were not hardcore pornography, which was the only material that he could consider holding to be unprotected by the First Amendment in Quantity of Books's companion case, Jacobellis v. Ohio (where he had also defined it with his oft-quoted line \""I know it when I see it\""). In dissent, Justice John Marshall Harlan II wrote for himself and Tom Clark in faulting Brennan's application of the precedents he relied on. He also disputed whether the procedure was truly prior restraint, since it did not review the material prior to publication. The Court, he concluded, was unfairly denying Kansas the full range of legal tools it might otherwise have had to pursue if it had decided it was an important state interest.",UnitOfWork,LegalCase,SupremeCourtOfTheUnitedStatesCase

"XORKO Collaborative Arts Movement was a cultural and artists' movement based in Cyprus that began on November 15, 2011, originally by Evagoras Bekiaris and Nico Stephou. XORKO in Cypriot Greek translates to village. The word was used metaphorically as a way to promote the idea of an environment similar to one that can be found in a village; and hence to create a sense of belonging between the members of the movement. Artistic liberation being a main aim of XORKO, was seen by the movement as only possible within a framework that could facilitate a roof for Cypriot artists to collaborate in a \""Do It Together\"" context, where XORKO acts as a platform/roof enabling all members to expand themselves in the context of art collaborations and not limit their art to just their personal forms of expression. XORKO promoted the notions of non-profiting and no sponsoring, opposing the \""industrialization of music\"" implemented by multinational record labels and other companies that promote the commodification of art. XORKO produced compilations with various music artists through this collaboration process, which it uploaded and distributed through SoundCloud. While XORKO had held various art events since its formation, it received wider coverage after holding two non-profit art festivals at Arminou village on July 2012 and August 2013, ran by volunteers.",Agent,Company,RecordLabel
"Diogo de Azambuja (born Montemor-o-Velho, 1432; died 1518) was a Portuguese noble. He was a knight of the Order of Aviz in the service of the Infante Dom Pedro, son of the Regent Infante Peter, Duke of Coimbra. After Peter's defeat and death in the battle of Alfarrobeira (1449), he accompanied his master into exile. In 1458 he fought on the side of Afonso V in the conquest of Alcácer-Ceguer in Morocco. He received several honours and became a counselor of the king. During the war of the Castilian Succession, he participated in the recapture of the town of Alegrete from the Castilians. He was injured in the leg during this engagement. In 1481 he was appointed by John II as captain of a fleet consisting of nine caravels and two ships with 600 soldiers and 100 masons and carpenters. They were sent, along with the necessary stone and other materials, to construct a fortress called São Jorge da Mina at the Gulf of Guinea. This became the best-known exploit of his long life. They chose a favourable defensive position for the fort, and construction was practically complete after only 20 days, in spite of resistance from the native population. With the fortress finished, friendly contacts were established with the native population to establish trade. Diogo de Azambuja sent the fleet back to Lisbon with word that the mission has been successfully accomplished, and he remained behind as captain of the fortress with a force of 60 soldiers. He held this post until 1484. He was rewarded by the king with the post of alcaide-mor of Monsaraz, and was also named to the Privy Council. Diogo de Azambuja remained attached to the Court and the king's service for many years, in spite of his advancing age and disabled leg. He was already over the age of 70 in 1506 when Manuel I placed him in charge of building a fortress called Castelo Real at Essaouira, near Safi, in the south of Morocco, to protect Portuguese interests in the area. Diogo of Azambuja not only carried out the mission, he also took the city of Safi, where he remained as captain until 1509, at the age of 77 years.

The Duluth campus, formerly the University of Minnesota Duluth School of Medicine, has approximately 60 students enrolled for each of the first two years of medical school. After that point, they are automatically transferred to the Twin Cities campus for their clinical rotations. The mission of the Duluth Campus is to select and educate students who will likely select Family Medicine/Primary Care and practice in rural locations. Duluth is also a primary site for the Center for American Indian and Minority Health which aims to educate increased numbers of Native American students as medical professionals. The larger of the two campuses is in the Twin Cities. This campus has approximately 170 students in each of the first two years of medical school with a mixture of traditional medical students and students pursuing combined advanced degrees such as a Ph.D. through a MSTP scholarship. As the larger of the two campuses, the Twin Cities campus provides increased opportunities for research and specialty care and also provides the main clinical education site for both campuses. Thus at the end of the fourth year, the total graduating class at Minneapolis usually exceeds 220 students. The University of Minnesota Medical school makes use of many teaching hospitals in the Twin Cities area. The University of Minnesota Medical Center is just one of these, others include Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC), Regions Hospital (St. Paul), North Memorial Hospital (Robbinsdale), Children Hospital of Minneapolis and St Paul, Abbott Northwestern hospital and the Minneapolis Veteran's Administration Hospital. The University of Minnesota Medical School offers seven dual-degree programs for students interested in combining their medical education with a degree in medical research (MD/PhD), public health (MD/MPH), biomedical engineering (MD/MS), law (MD/JD), business (MD/MBA), or health informatics (MD/MHI). The University of Minnesota Medical School is also part of one of the largest Academic Health Centers (AHC) in the United States. This center allows health professionals to train collaboratively during the course of their training programs. The AHC comprises the Medical School, School of Dentistry, School of Nursing, College of Pharmacy, School of Public Health and the College of Veterinary Medicine. In addition to training medical students for their MD degrees the University of Minnesota Medical School also has numerous residencies as part of their graduate medical education programs.

"Smilin' Through is a 1919 play by Jane Cowl and Jane Murfin, written under a pseudonym, Allan Langdon Martin. Cowl also starred in the play in a double role and co-directed it with Priestly Morrison. Smilin' Through was produced by The Selwyns and opened at the Broadhurst Theatre on Broadway on December 30, 1919. It included in the cast Orme Caldara as Kenneth and Jeremiah Wayne, Henry Stephenson as John Carteret and Ethelbert D. Hales as Dr. Owen Harding. Scenic design was by Joseph Urban. The play was a popular hit and ran for 175 performances. It also played for a long run on the road, and was one of Jane Cowl's greatest commercial successes. The story is a sentimental romantic tale of a young Irish woman, Kathleen Dungannon. Her romantic attachment to Kenneth Wayne is opposed by her adopted father John Carteret, who bears the painful memory of his thwarted love for her aunt, Moonyean Clare. Moonyean visits John as a ghost, and the roles of Kathleen and Moonyean were both played by Jane Cowl. The popular story was first filmed in 1922 by First National Pictures, and was later remade twice by MGM, in 1932 and 1941. In 1932, it was also made into an unsuccessful Broadway operetta, Through the Years, with music by Vincent Youmans. The title song of the operetta, however, became a hit. Smilin' Through is also the title of a 1919 ballad with lyrics and music by Arthur A. Penn. The creation of the song and play were independent but intertwined. According to Isidore Witmark in his history of the Witmark and Sons publishing house, Cowl's play was partially rewritten after the song was published, based upon the imagery of the lyrics.

"Hasegg Castle (German: Burg Hasegg) is a castle and mint located in Hall in Tirol, Tyrol, Austria. Construction was completed soon after 1300, when Hall was rapidly becoming the center of Tyrolean commerce and salt mining. The building was originally erected to protect the salt mines, the shipping industry, the bridge across the river Inn and the old Roman Road. The castle's mint was established by Sigismund, Archduke of Austria in 1477. The first dollar-size silver coin was struck in 1486: the Guldengroschen. When Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria had the old mint transferred from the Castle of Sparberegg to Hasegg in 1567, Hall experienced a decisive upswing. Between 1748 and 1768, Hasegg Castle became universally famous for its minting of silver Thalers of which it produced over 17 million specimens. The Thaler, a silver coin used throughout Europe for almost four hundred years, sees its name live on in various currencies as the \""dollar\"" or \""tolar\"".

"Saint Sebastian (died c. 288 AD) was an early Christian saint and martyr. According to Christian belief, he was killed during the Roman emperor Diocletian's persecution of Christians. He is commonly depicted in art and literature tied to a post or tree and shot with arrows. Despite this being the most common artistic depiction of Sebastian, he was, according to legend, rescued and healed by Irene of Rome. Shortly afterwards he went to Diocletian to warn him about his sins, and as a result was clubbed to death. He is venerated in the Catholic and Orthodox Churches. The details of Saint Sebastian's martyrdom were first spoken of by 4th-century bishop Ambrose of Milan (Saint Ambrose), in his sermon (number 22) on Psalm 118. Ambrose stated that Sebastian came from Milan and that he was already venerated there at that time. Saint Sebastian is a popular male saint, especially among athletes.",Agent,Cleric,Saint

"Folsom Dam is a concrete gravity dam on the American River of Northern California in the United States, about 25 mi (40 km) northeast of Sacramento. The dam is 340 ft (100 m) high and 1,400 ft (430 m) long, flanked by earthen wing dams. It was completed in 1955, officially opening the following year. Located at the juncture of the north and south forks of the American River, the dam was built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and was transferred to the United States Bureau of Reclamation upon its completion. The dam and its reservoir, Folsom Lake, are part of the Central Valley Project, a multipurpose project that provides flood control, hydroelectricity, and irrigation and municipal water supply. In order to increase Sacramento's flood protection to 200 year flood protection (meaning that the area is protected from a flood that has a 0.5% chance of occurring in any given year) the US Army Corp of Engineers is constructing an auxiliary spillway. The spillway is scheduled to be completed by October 2017, and will enable Folsom dam to release water before it reaches the height of the gates already in place.

"The Patroon Island Bridge is a major crossing of the Hudson River in Albany, New York. The bridge carries Interstate 90, in the east-west direction, over the Hudson River between Albany and Rensselaer Counties. It has been in service since 1968; however, some structural repairs were made in 1992. The bridge consists of ten spans. Seven spans are considered the main spans and consist of steel trusses and concrete decks. The other three spans are considered approach spans, which are supported by plate girders. The main span over the river-shipping channel is 375 feet (114 m) long and 89 feet (27 m) wide, and the overall bridge length is 1,795 feet (547 m). There is an estimated 60 feet (18 m) of clearance for shipping on the Hudson River below, which changes with the local tide. Today's replacement cost is estimated to be between $80 and $100 million. The bridge has an HS Inventory load rating of 35 tons, and is inspected annually. The average daily traffic count was 70,787 in 1998 with a 4.5 percent estimated traffic growth during the life of the bridge. The bridge's design is similar to that of the Interstate 35W bridge in Minneapolis, MN, which collapsed during rush hour on August 1, 2007. This realization by New York State transportation officials prompted full-scale inspections of the state's major highway bridges, including the Patroon Island Bridge. Subsequently, the bridge was deemed safe for the time being, but would need substantial repairs and retrofitting in order to ensure motorist safety, and to extend its useful service life if replacement was found not to be a viable option in the near future. On May 31, 2016, the New York State Department of Transportation declared that it had completed a $148-million-dollar renovation and rebuild of the bridge. The bridge's name comes from the former (Lower) Patroon Island that once existed adjacent to the bridge. A patroon was a proprietor of a tract of land in the 17th-century Dutch colony of New Netherland in North America.",Place,RouteOfTransportation,Bridge

Upon his election, Lee was sworn into office as clerk of court on June 7, 1956, by his predecessor, Richard Kenneth Reed (1917-1999), a real estate businessman from Mamou, who held the position for the preceding eight years.

Deshotel then defeated Soileau, 52-48 percent, to claim the right to succeed Lee.

"Hugh Lachlan Porter (25 January 1911 – 8 January 1982) was an English cricketer. Porter was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm slow. He was born at Kensington, London. Porter made his debut for Suffolk against Lincolnshire in the 1934 Minor Counties Championship. Prior to the start of World War II in 1939, Porter made 32 appearances for Suffolk in the Minor Counties Championship. Playing minor counties cricket for Suffolk allowed him to be selected to play for a combined Minor Counties cricket team, who he made his first-class debut for against Cambridge University at Fenner's in 1935. The Minor Counties won the toss and elected to bat first, making 195 all out, with Porter being dismissed for 38 runs by Jahangir Khan. Cambridge University then made 163 all out in their first-innings, to which the Minor Counties responded in their second-innings by making 144 all out, with Porter being dismissed for 4 runs by James Grimshaw. Set a target of 177 for victory, Cambridge University reached their target with four wickets to spare. He made a second first-class appearance for the team in 1935 against Oxford University at the University Parks. Oxford University won the toss and elected to bat first, reaching 169/4. With the match heavily impacted by poor weather, this was the only innings possible during the match, which ended as a draw.

"Alan Alexander Buchanan (28 February 1905 – 4 February 1984) was an Anglican bishop in the second half of the 20th century.  Educated at Masonic Boys School and Trinity College, Dublin, he was ordained in 1931. He served as a chaplain with military forces during the Second World War, notably parachuting into Arnhem in 1944 and being captured by the Germans. In the Airborne Museum at Oosterbeek there is a serviceman's prayer card displayed which is signed by Alan Buchanan. He was with the Church of Ireland Mission in Belfast until 1937, after which he held incumbencies at St Cedma Inver and St Mary, Belfast and St Comgall, Bangor. He was Bishop of Clogher from 1958 to 1969, when he became Archbishop of Dublin and Primate of Ireland. He resigned in 1977 and died on 4 February 1984. Among other things, Archbishop Buchanan was known as an advocate for women's ministry. In the early 1970s, he had spoken to the Diocesan Synod of Dublin: \""Is it right to limits the possibility of ordination to one half of the Church? Our House of Bishops has recently echoed the view of Lambeth that there is no theological reason against the ordination of women. The Church in Canda has already decided in favour...the Church of Ireland should at least declare its mind on the subject.\"" He personally invited and trained the first five women to be commissioned Lay Readers in the Church of Ireland in 1975, including Daphne Wormell and Patricia Hastings-Hardy. When the group chose a maroon liturgical gown, which looks similar to the bishops' red, he told them, \""If they like to think I am commissioning five lady bishops, let them think it!\"" His daughter, Desiree Stedman, was ordained in the Anglican Church of Canada.

"Cassady is a grape variety which is greenish-white in color. It is related to the \""Fox Grape\"", Vitis labrusca, and it is an offspring of an open pollination variant of V. labrusca, which means that it is classified as an interspecific crossing, a hybrid grape. It was first described in the Interim Fruit Report of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society in November, 1853. The first Cassady grapevine sprang up as a volunteer (unplanted) seedling in the yard of P.H. Cassady at 29 Logan Square, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1847. It did not bear fruit for five years, but when it finally did, the grapes it produced were found by Cassady to be juicy, pleasantly flavoured, and of very good quality. The Cassady grape was propagated and subsequently crossed with the better-known Concord grape to produce a new white grape variety, the Niagara grape, which is the cultivar most commonly used for the production of white grape juice in North America.

"George Barker (1844–1894) was a Canadian-American photographer best known for his photographs of Niagara Falls. He was born in London, Ontario, and began his training with James Egan. By the age of 18, he had opened his own studio in London, but the next year, he moved to Niagara Falls, New York, where he worked for Platt D. Babbitt. In the late 1860s, he had studios in both London and Niagara Falls, and he became known nationwide for his large-format (up to 18 in × 20 in (46 cm × 51 cm)) and stereographic prints of the falls. His Niagara studio was destroyed by fire on February 7, 1870, but his negatives survived. Barker was also one of the earliest photographers to visit the state of Florida. At the time, photography in Florida was challenging, as much of the state remained undeveloped, which meant photographers needed to carry their bulky equipment through the state's wetlands and subtropical jungles, as well as deal with delicate film in hot and humid conditions. Barker spent nearly four years (on and off), from 1886 to 1890, documenting much of northern and central Florida.

"Timothy Joseph Zoehrer (born 25 September 1961 in St John of God Subiaco, Western Australia) is a former Australian cricket player. He played as a wicket-keeper. He began his career in the 1980–81 season with Western Australia in the Sheffield Shield as an understudy to Rod Marsh. After Marsh's retirement he became the number one state keeper and eventually the Australian Test keeper. He played ten Test matches between 1986 and 1987 when Australia were far from the top team in the world, touring New Zealand and India. He also played 22 One Day Internationals. Zoehrer claims he was replaced as first-choice keeper after a personality clash with Australian coach and newly appointed selector, Bob Simpson. He was replaced firstly by Greg Dyer and then Ian Healy. Zoehrer did, though, tour England twice, in 1989 and 1993, as Healy's deputy. Zoehrer played his final One Day International in 1994, at Perth vs South Africa, seven years after his previous appearance again as a replacement for a rested Healy. Zoehrer was a successful and popular keeper for Western Australia with a state record of 360 dismissals and also took 38 first-class wickets with his leg break bowling. In both of his tours of England he topped the first class bowling averages for the Australians on tour, taking 1 wicket for 9 runs in 1989 and 12 wickets at an average of 20.8 in 1993. However he never bowled at Test or One Day International level. He was controversially replaced by NSW's Adam Gilchrist at the beginning of the 1994-95 season and never played first class or list-A cricket again.

"Imperator torosus, commonly known as the brawny bolete, is a species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. It is native to southern Europe east to the Caucasus and Israel. It is generally associated with deciduous trees such as hornbeam, oak and beech in warm, dry locales. Although generally rare in Europe, it appears to be relatively common in Hungary. Appearing in summer and autumn on chalky soils, the stocky fruit bodies have an ochre cap up to 20 cm (8 in) across, yellow pores on the cap underside, and a wine-red to brown or blackish stipe up to 6–15 cm (2.4–5.9 in) long by 3–6 cm (1.2–2.4 in) wide. The pale yellow flesh changes to different colours when broken or bruised depending on age; younger mushrooms become reddish, and older ones additionally take on bluish tones. Elias Magnus Fries and Christopher Theodor Hök first described this species as Boletus torosus in 1835, a name by which it was known for many years. Modern molecular phylogenetics shows that it is only distantly related to Boletus edulis—the type species of Boletus—and it was duly placed in the new genus Imperator in 2015. Eating raw mushrooms of this species leads to vomiting and diarrhea. Gastrointestinal symptoms have also occurred after eating cooked specimens, though some people have eaten it without ill-effects.",Species,Eukaryote,Fungus
"Caririemys violetae is an extinct side-necked turtle belonging to the Pelomedusoides of the family Euraxemydidae. As with many described extinct taxa, it is the only known species in its genus Caririemys. A single fossil of an individual was found in the Santana Formation in Brazil, an 80-million-year-old Cretaceous deposit that has so far preserved other fossil reptiles such as dinosaurs and crocodilians. Because the few remains used to describe the species were incomplete, anatomical characteristics used to differentiate Caririemys from other extinct and extant pleurodirans are derived mostly from the arrangement of the bony plates that form its domed carapace. The genus and species were first described in 2007, from the fragmentary remains of a single fossil specimen unearthed in Northeastern Brazil two years prior to the publication of the description. The Santana Formation of Brazil where the specimen was discovered is a treasure-trove of prehistoric turtle remains including the early sea turtle Santanachelys. Caririemys was the fifth unique testudine genus to have been described from fossils found in the Romualdo Member section of the geologic formation. The lone specimen, officially labeled as MN6919-v now resides in the Museu Nacional da Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro. The turtle skeleton found consisted of parts of the turtle’s carapace, a few vertebral elements and a matching femur and pelvis. Since most of the elements used to systematically classify a fossil turtle in the Pleurodira (such as the skull) were missing, the species’ affiliation was determined by the attachment of the specimen's pelvis to its carapace. Closer approximation and analysis of its carapace elements have shown that Caririemys is closely related to the turtle Euraxemys essweini from the same geographic locality and strata. The genus was named for the city of Santana do Cariri where the fossil was unearthed. The species' specific name, violetae, honors Violeta Arraes, a former dean at the nearby Universidade Regional do Cariri. Arraes was a prominent local political figure during the 20th century and became instrumental in the development of paleontological studies in the area when she was appointed dean of the Universidade Regional do Cariri in 1997.",Species,Animal,Reptile

"The National Front (French: Front national, pronounced: [fʁɔ̃ na.sjɔ.nal]; FN) is a socially conservative, nationalist political party in France. Its major policies include economic protectionism, a zero tolerance approach to law and order issues, and opposition to immigration. A eurosceptic party, the FN has opposed the European Union since its creation in 1993. Most political commentators place the FN on the right to far right but party representatives reject this and suggest other ways of looking at the left–right axis. The party was founded in 1972 to unify a variety of French nationalist movements of the time. Jean-Marie Le Pen was the party's first leader and the undisputed centre of the party from its start until his resignation in 2011. Marine Le Pen, his daughter, was elected as the current leader. While the party struggled as a marginal force for its first ten years, since 1984 it has been the major force of French nationalism. The 2002 presidential election was the first in France to include a National Front candidate in the run-off, after Jean-Marie Le Pen beat the Socialist candidate in the first round. In the run-off, he finished a distant second to Jacques Chirac. Due to the French electoral system, the party's representation in public office has been limited, despite its significant share of the vote. While her father was nicknamed the \""Devil of the Republic\"" by mainstream media, Marine Le Pen pursued a policy of \""de-demonization\"" of the party by softening its image. She endeavoured to extract it from its far-right cultural roots, and to normalize it by giving it a culture of government, expelling controversial members like her father, who was suspended, and then expelled by his own party in 2015 after he referred, once again, to the Nazi gas chambers as \""a point of detail of the history of the Second World War\""; he later set up the Blue, White and Red Rally. Since her election as the leader of the party in 2011, the popularity of the FN continued to grow apace: the party won several municipalities at the 2014 municipal elections; it became the first French party at the 2014 European elections with 25% of the votes; and again in the last departmental elections in France. They, once again, came out in 1st place in the last regional elections with a historic result of nearly 28% of the votes.

"Luigi Facta (November 16, 1861, Pinerolo, Province of Turin – November 5, 1930, Pinerolo) was an Italian politician, journalist and last Prime Minister of Italy before the leadership of Benito Mussolini. Facta was born in Pinerolo, Piedmont, Italy. He studied law and later became a journalist. He entered politics in 1892 when he was elected to the chamber of deputies for Pinerolo, a seat which he held for 30 years. Facta, a member of the Liberal Party, served as undersecretary of the justice and interior departments in the coalition cabinets for much of his time in Parliament. He was also finance minister from 1910 until 1914 and 1920 until 1921. At the outbreak of World War I, Facta supported neutrality for Italy, but then supported the war when Italy entered it. His son was killed in the war, and he said that he was proud to give a son to his country. Facta was appointed Prime Minister in February 1922. At the time, Italy was in political turmoil, and was dealing with Mussolini's fascist insurgency. When Mussolini decided to march on Rome, Facta reacted and wanted to declare the martial law and send the army to stop Mussolini. Such a declaration needed to bear the monarch's signature before it could take effect. Facta always refused to explain the secret reasons that brought the King Victor Emmanuel III not to sign the declaration of emergency. The following day Facta and his government resigned to demonstrate they did not approve the King's decision. The King then asked Mussolini to form a new government. In 1924, King Victor Emmanuel III named Facta senator. Facta died in Pinerolo, Italy, in 1930 with the general population believing him to have been too feeble and faithful to the King to take a more active role in stopping Mussolini and the rise of Fascism.",Agent,Politician,PrimeMinister

"Gerardo Barrios (September 24, 1813 – August 29, 1865) was President of El Salvador, from 12 March 1859 to 26 October 1863. Barrios was a liberal and supported the unity of Central America. He was, from a young age, part of the army of the last president of Federation of Central American Estates, Francisco Morazan. After his death he became the leader or the unionist movement.He served as president of El Salvador several times - in 1858, from 1859 to 1860 and again from 1861. He was known for his concern for international relations and is attributed for introducing coffee production to El Salvador, accelerating the spread through Central America. Coffee became the basis of El Salvador's economy. Between 1860 and 1863, Barrios launched a reorganization of the public finances and promoted the coffee production and silk-elaboration related activities. He also created a professional armed force, and favored non-religious public education. In his first years of government he looked for a pacific convivance with Guatemala, which made him visit that country in 1860. However, conflicts were not absent, especially with the church. One of the first incidents was the expulsion of three capuccine religious. In 1860, conflicts escalated when the clerk represented by bishop Tomás Pineda y Zaldaña, denied to accept the Constitution on the Republic, claiming that none of the priests were committed to obey the government, because the only authority above all earth is God, the bishop and the Pope. Conservatives felt outraged by Barrios, claiming he was anti-clerical, despotic and liberal. Many conservatives, including bishop Pineda y Zaldaña, had to look for shelter in Guatemala and from there they launched a newspaper campaign against the Salvadoran government. In 1861 attacks were strong, and even worse, a confrontational climate began to grow between the two countries. Particularly because of Guatemala's President aspirations to become the controller of Central America. In 1863, after a few border skirmishes El Salvador declared war on Guatemala, and on June 19 Guatemalan troops began invading El Salvador. On October 26, after a long siege, Carrera took over San Salvador, taking full control of the city. The same year Barrios escaped to San Miguel. With Carrera's approval, Francisco Dueñas installed himself as a president and won the 1865 elections. As a constitutional president, he promoted a trial against Barrios, who was captured in Nicaragua on July 27 and extradited to El Salvador the same week. The court martial began on August 10, and he was sentenced to death on August 28; the execution took place the following day. In 1910 he was officially granted a title of 'national hero' for his heroic efforts to protect the rights of the farming communities as well as leading his military triumphs to protect Central America from foreign invasions. His name has been honored by naming national institutions, two cities (Ciudad Barrios and San Gerardo), and a major street after him, as well as having his life taught at schools.",Agent,Politician,President

"Beagle 2 was a British landing spacecraft that formed part of the European Space Agency's 2003 Mars Express mission. The craft lost contact with Earth during its final descent and its fate was unknown for over twelve years. Beagle 2 is named after HMS Beagle, the ship used by Charles Darwin. The spacecraft was successfully deployed from the Mars Express on 19 December 2003 and was scheduled to land on the surface of Mars on 25 December; however, no contact was received at the expected time of landing on Mars, with the ESA declaring the mission lost in February 2004, after numerous attempts to contact the spacecraft were made.

"The Torneo Gran Alternativa (Spanish for \""the Great Alternative Tournament\"") is an annual lucha libre (professional wrestling) tournament held by the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). The tournament was not held in 1997, 2000, or 2002, but was held twice in 1996 and 1998. The most recent Torneo Gran Alternativa tournament was held in February 2014. The tournament has always been held in Arena Mexico in Mexico City, Mexico, the main arena of CMLL. Up until 2010 the tournament format was that of eight tag teams facing off in a one night, single elimination tournament, sometimes with a match to determine the seeds for the tournament. In 2010 the field of competitors was doubled to 16 and the tournament would take place over three shows, with eight teams facing off in Block A, the other eight in Block B and the two block winners would wrestle the following week. All tournament matches except the finals are single fall matches, while the finals are a best two-out-of-three falls per lucha libre traditions. The concept of the tournament is to team a young up-and-comer with a veteran and use the tournament to help showcase the younger talent, the young winner is often someone CMLL has plans for, although at times it has not always had the desired result. Último Guerrero is the only wrestler to have won the tournament three times, in  as the rookie and in  and 2011 as the veteran of the team.

"Ullswater Community College (UCC) is a large mixed comprehensive school in Penrith, Cumbria. It currently has around 1450 students, including about 200 in the sixth form. The School was formed under the name of Ullswater High School in 1980 when Tynefield (girls) and Ullswater (boys) secondary modern schools merged. The school still has two sets of all facilities (two halls, two gyms, two kitchens) and there is still the 'Mixed Yard' in the middle of the school. This was a playground where boys and girls were allowed to 'mix' at breaks. The two main blocks of the school consist of the former schools, now renamed Cumberland block and Westmorland block, named after the historic counties Cumberland and Westmorland that became Cumbria in 1974. The character of the school comes from two main factors. The first is its enormous catchment area, the largest in England. The second is the existence of its neighbour and great rival, Queen Elizabeth Grammar School ('QEGS'). QEGS is a selective school. Mr David Robinson served as headmaster until 2004 thereafter the school was led by Mr Stewart Gimber as the head teacher. UCC had a good Inspection in 2006 but in 2009 it was given a Notice to Improve by Ofsted.

The governors defended their actions saying that the rise was due to the school meeting the targets that they had set for Mr. Pattinson. However, in the Cumberland and Westmorland Herald, one reader pointed out that if he had met the target's then he had obviously not done so without the assistance of other staff.

In December 2010 the Minnesota Daily published a report that Harris kept associate women's head coach Katie Brenny from coaching, traveling with the team, or recruiting while letting his son-in-law and former caddy, Ernie Rose, perform those duties under a different title. Harris resigned as director of golf in June 2011. In March 2014, Hennepin County Judge Thomas M. Sipkins awarded Katie Brenny $359,000 in a discrimination lawsuit related to her treatment by Harris and Rose while at the University of Minnesota.

"Graphis is a genus of lichenized fungi in the family Graphidaceae. According to the Dictionary of the Fungi (10th edition, 2008), the widespread genus contains 386 species. Graphidaceae isone of the most prevailing species in lichen communities, though its classification is not well developed. Previously, the graphidoid members of Graphidaceae sensu were divided into the genera Graphis,Graphina, Phaeographis, and Phaeographina, contingent on if the ascospores are septate or muriform, colorless or greyish brown. Septate in terms of mycology refers to the condition where there is a lack of partition dividing filamentous hyphae into discrete cells in fungi. This notion was thought of as synthetic and adjustments of Acanthothecis andDyplolabia changed the method to a more natural generic classificationof the family. A set of characteristics such as excipulum and hamathecium structure, ascospore color and iodine reaction, and chemistry, was suggested to reach a much more sufficient genus model. The excipulum is the cup shaped tissue that holds the hymenium, asci, in the apothecium. The hamathecium is the hypha emerging between the asci of the hymenium. Thallus color, thallus cortex, vegetative propagules, lirella emergence, thalline margine of lirella, relative length and branching of lirellae, disc exposure, labia and disc pruinosity, labium striation, excipulum carbonization, hymenium inspersion, and ascospores are all considered when characterizing Graphis. \n*  Thallus color- The majority of Graphis species have a large amount of calcium oxalate crystals in the photobiont layer and which results in a white-grey thallus. Some but few taxa have an olive-green color close to Phaeographis and other related species because the crystal clusters are located below the photobiont layer instead of in or above layer. Staining in the herbarium constituent is common and due to incorrect aeration causing breakdown of secondary substances. In these cases, a hand-cut section of the thallus aids to classify the thallus type and regular color. \n*  Thallus cortex- Species with a corticate thallus have a compact, slightly shiny exterior, whereas ecorticate taxa show a lusterless, coarse or farinose thallus under the dissecting microscope. If present, a cortex is recognized as a thin but characteristic, hyaline layer of condensed, parallel hyphae in hand-cut sections under the compound microscope. \n*  Vegetative propagules- Only four species have isidia and one has soralia which are powdery propagules composed of fungal hyphae. Isidia are the vegetative reproductive structures in lichens and are usually numerous in G. isidiata, G. isidiza, and G. patwardhanii, but scattered and easily overlooked in G. stellata, so vigilant examination of the thallus surface is necessary.",Species,Eukaryote,Fungus
"Sam & Max Save the World is a graphic adventure video game developed by Telltale Games. The game was originally released as Sam & Max: Season One before being renamed in early 2009. Save the World was developed in episodic fashion, comprising six episodes that were released for Microsoft Windows over the course of late 2006 and early 2007. The episodes were initially distributed online by GameTap and Telltale Games themselves, although the later retail releases of the game were published by The Adventure Company and JoWooD Productions in North America and Europe respectively. A Wii port of the game was published in late 2008, and an Xbox Live Arcade version was released in mid-2009. Based on Steve Purcell's comic book series Sam & Max, the game follows the title characters Sam and Max—self-styled vigilante private investigators, the former an anthropomorphic dog and the latter a \""hyperkinetic rabbity thing\""—through several cases involving a hypnotism conspiracy. Each episode features one case with a contained story, with an underlying plot running through the series. The game was announced by Telltale Games in 2005 following the cancellation of Sam & Max: Freelance Police by LucasArts in the preceding year; many of the employees at Telltale Games were members of the Freelance Police development team. The game received a positive response from critics, with praise bestowed on the game's humor, graphics and gameplay. However, concerns were voiced over the low difficulty of the puzzles, repetition in design between episodes and the effectiveness of the story. Opinions dissented across the Atlantic; some British reviewers did not appreciate the writing in the way that American critics did. Nevertheless, the game has won several awards and is often cited by commentators as the first successful application of episodic distribution. The game was accompanied by a number of short machinima videos set between each episode. The game was followed by two episodic sequels: Sam & Max Beyond Time and Space in 2007 and Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse in 2010",Work,Software,VideoGame

"Alain Marie Pascal Prost, OBE, Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur (born 24 February 1955) is a French former racing driver. A four-time Formula One Drivers' Champion, only Sebastian Vettel (four championships), Juan Manuel Fangio (five championships), and Michael Schumacher (seven championships) have equalled or surpassed his number of titles. From 1987 until 2001 Prost held the record for most Grand Prix victories. Schumacher surpassed Prost's total of 51 victories at the 2001 Belgian Grand Prix. In 1999, Prost received the World Sports Awards of the Century in the motor sport category. Prost discovered karting at the age of 14 during a family holiday. He progressed through motor sport's junior ranks, winning the French and European Formula Three championships, before joining the McLaren Formula One team in 1980 at the age of 24. He finished in the points on his Formula One début at the San Martin Autodrome in Buenos Aires, Argentina (where he took his first podium a year later) and took his first race victory at his home Grand Prix in France a year later, driving for the factory Renault team. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Prost formed a fierce rivalry mainly with Ayrton Senna, but also Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell. In 1986, at the last race of the season, he beat Mansell and Piquet of Williams to the title after Mansell retired late on in the race, and Piquet was pulled in for a late precautionary pit stop. Senna joined Prost at McLaren in 1988 and the two had a series of controversial clashes, including a collision at the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix that gave Prost his third Drivers' Championship. A year later at the same venue they collided again, but this time Prost, driving for Ferrari, lost out. Before the end of a winless 1991 season Prost was fired by Ferrari for his public criticism of the team. After a sabbatical in 1992, Prost joined the Williams team, prompting reigning drivers' champion Mansell to leave for CART. With a competitive car, Prost won the 1993 championship and retired from Formula One driving at the end of the year. In 1997, Prost took over the French Ligier team, running it as Prost Grand Prix until it went bankrupt in 2002. From 2003 to 2012 he competed in the Andros Trophy, which is an ice racing championship, taking 38 race victories and winning the championship 3 times. Prost employed a smooth, relaxed style behind the wheel, deliberately modeling himself on personal heroes like Jackie Stewart and Jim Clark. He was nicknamed \""The Professor\"" for his intellectual approach to competition. Though it was not a name he particularly cared for, he would admit later that it was an appropriate summation of his approach to his racing. Skilled at setting up his car for race conditions, Prost would often conserve his brakes and tyres early in a race, leaving them fresher for a challenge at the end.",Agent,RacingDriver,FormulaOneRacer
"Du Xinwu (Chinese: 杜心武; Wade–Giles: Tu Hsin-wu; 1869–1953), aka Ru Xia (儒侠), Dou Mi Guan Jushi (斗米观居士) was a Chinese martial artist and an important figure in the development of Zi Ran Men kung fu. Du was born into a wealthy family in the city of Zhangjiajie in Hunan province. He started training in martial arts at the age of six, and by the time he was nine he was a student of a local martial arts master named Yang Ke. After becoming involved with a revolutionary anti-government movement, Du was forced to flee from Zhangjiajie to the province of Yunnan. Here, in an attempt to find a new teacher, he issued a general challenge by posting a notice on a street corner. The challenge was met by a beggar named Xu (Hsu), a dwarf. Xu soundly defeated Du and then took him on as a student, teaching him the Zi Ran Men style. Du trained with Xu, travelling across the country with him, until the age of 16. Du was a user of opium even at this young age, and Xu openly disapproved of the habit. On one occasion, incensed at Xu's criticism, Du ambushed his teacher on a bridge, but was surprised when the dwarf overpowered him, knocked him from the bridge and saved him by catching his queue. After leaving Xu, Du worked as a security guard escorting people and goods. In 1900, he travelled to Japan to study at Tokyo Agricultural University, where he met and befriended the revolutionary leader Song Jiaoren. An introduction from Song led to Du being employed as Sun Yat-sen's personal bodyguard. Now fully engaged with the revolutionary movement, Du used his contacts in China's Tiandihui underworld to help Sun establish the Tongmenghui Party. He abandoned politics after Song's death, and concentrated on esoteric religious practices. He was arrested and imprisoned by the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War, but escaped. He then travelled to Chongqing, where he co-ordinated activities against the Japanese. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China he served in the Ministry of Agriculture and as a consultant to the Hunan Provincial People's Political Committee. Du died from a recurrent injury in 1953 at the age of 84. Du was noted for his exceptional martial abilities, particularly his skill in kicking.

"Lindsaeaseae is a pantropical family of ferns in the order Polypodiales. It contains six (or seven) genera with about 220 known species, some of which also extend into the more temperate regions of eastern Asia, New Zealand, and South America. For more than a century, these ferns were considered part of the Davalliaceae. Then starting in the mid-twentieth century they began to be transferred to the Dennstaedtiaceae. Molecular data supported the separation of Lindsaeaseae into its own family, which was proposed in 1970. Lindsaeaseae is considered the most basal of the Polypodiales. Characteristics include: Rhizomes short to long creeping; rhizomes with nonclathrate scales or uniserate hairs; blades 1-3 pinnate or more divided; veins usually free; sori marginal or submarginal; indusia open towards margin, sometimes attached at sides, or sori covered by the reflexed segment margin The genus Lonchitis has many morphological characteristics similar to Dennstaedtiaceae, but a few characteristics of the spore are similar to the lindsaeoid genera, and molecular data strongly places this genus in Lindsaeaseae",Species,Plant,Fern

"Chœurs is a joint musical album by Bertrand Cantat, Pascal Humbert, Bernard Falaise and Alexander MacSween released on Actes Sud label on 16 December 2011, although it was made available for downloads on 21 November 2011. The 17 tracks on the album are based on the text of Sophocles translated by Robert Davreu, being the Greek chorus parts of the theatrical trilogy adaptation Le Cycle des Femmes: Trois histoires de Sophocle or just Des femmes (being the Sophocles pieces Women of Trachis, Antigone and Electra by the Lebanese-Quebec artist Wajdi Mouawad in June 2011 and presented initially at Festival d'Avignon in 2011. The tracks 1 to 8 is from Women of Trachis, tracks 9 to 13 from Antigone and 14 to 17 from Electra. The release coincided with the Paris presentation of Le Cycle des Femmes: Trois histoires de Sophocle on Théâtre Nanterre-Amandiers in the Paris region. As Bertrand Cantat could not take part in certain presentations because of backlash to his earlier criminal record and role in murder of Marie Trintignant, in those locations his vocals were replaced by various vocalists, with concern that the authenticity of the vocals was jeopardised. But Cantat did sing actually in productions in Bordeaux region on 28 June 2011 at the Rocher de Palmer in Cenon followed by shows in Bourges, Reims, Brest, Lyon, Geneva and Athens. His scheduled appearance in Montreal's Théâtre du Nouveau Monde in May 2012 was cancelled after pressure from feminist groups and his role was taken over by Igor Quezada. The album was released as a book disc of 32 pages and an introduction to the play by Moawad and a picture gallery in black and white and in color by Jean-Louis Fernandez. The cover photo for the release depicted Samuël Côté and Oreste. Chœurs is the first album of Bertrand Cantat, since the album Nous n'avons fait que fuir (recorded in 2002, released in 2004), and the official demise of the group Noir Désir announced in November 2010. This is also the first album in which Cantat was credited directly rather than his band. Wajdi Mouawad declared he loved Cantat's vocals for a long time and had incorporated materials from Noir Désir in his earlier creation Temps in 2010, and asked Cantat to record texts for his work Ciels in 2009. Bertrand Cantat agreed to do the recording provided his long-time friend Pascal Humbert was involved in the project to which Moawad agreed. Moawad also added two Quebec artists, the guitarist Bernard Falaise and drummer Alexander MacSween to complete the rock quartet. The album was recorded in Studio Davout in Paris under the production of Jean-Loup Morette and in Studio Anywave in Bordeaux under the production of Nicolas Perego; mixing was by Jean-Loup Morette in Paris and the mastering by Bruno Green in Lennoxville, Quebec.",Work,MusicalWork,Album

Using her own Death Note, a notebook that allows its owner to kill anyone simply by knowing their name and face that she received from the Shinigami Rem, Misa does everything she can to aid Light. This includes shortening her own lifespan by half, twice, in order to receive the eyes of a Shinigami, giving her the ability to learn a person's name just by looking at their face. Although Misa fills the traditional role of the love interest, her relationship with Light is one-sided as he uses her simply for his own gains. In the anime adaptation, Misa is voiced by Aya Hirano in Japanese and by Shannon Chan-Kent in the English version. In the live-action adaptations, she is portrayed by Erika Toda in the films, by Fuka Yuzuki in the musical, and by Hinako Sano in the television drama.

"Danas (Serbo-Croatian for \""today\""), is a daily newspaper published in Belgrade, Serbia. It was established in 1997 after a group of discontented journalists from the Naša borba newspaper walked out after getting into a conflict with the paper's new private majority owner. The first issue of Danas appeared on 9 June 1997. Right from the start the paper employed a strong independent editorial policy with respect to Milošević's regime. Because of open reporting and uncensored coverage on issues and events plaguing Yugoslav and Serbian society in the late 1990s, the paper often found itself targeted by Serbian authorities. Danas was one of the three newspapers (Dnevni telegraf and Naša borba being the other two) to be banned by governmental decree on 14 October 1998 for \""spreading fear and defeatism\"" at a time when NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia seemed a distinct possibility. As the threat of bombing went away (for a few months anyway), the ban was lifted on 20 October 1998, only to be replaced by a piece of legislation called the Information Law. Under that law, Danas was fined severely and on numerous occasions. The paper's day-to-day operations were often under threat of shutting down until the regime was finally overthrown on 5 October 2000. In the period since the regime change, Danas has been one of the rare Serbian newspapers (or Serbian media outlets in general, for that matter) to ignore the commercial temptations of yellow journalism. Its circulation has been continually in decline. Most of the foreign investors in Serbian media market have been avoiding it. Today, Danas is a left-oriented media, promoting issues related to former Yugoslavia, social-democracy and European integrations. It is among rare media supporters of Serbian NGO activities towards human rights and minorities protection.

"Cottage Savings Association v. Commissioner, 499 U.S. 554 (1991), was an income tax case before the Supreme Court of the United States.

The Court determined that it was a \""disposition of property\"" by making the following three holdings: \n* Under § 1001(a), exchange of property gives rise to realization (a \""disposition of property\"") only if the exchanged properties are \""materially different.\"" \n* This concept of \""material difference\"" is not defined by an economic substitute test (whether various parties would consider their differences to be \""material\""); rather, two properties are materially different if their respective possessors enjoy legal entitlements that are different in kind or extent. \n* The S&L's 90% participation interest in its mortgages embodied legally distinct entitlements (and so was \""materially different\"" from) the 90% mortgage participation interest it received from the other savings associations.

Sounds incorporated in this work were sampled in variety of abandoned factories and wild forests in rural Russia. Next EP was called \""ГЕНШТАБ ДЕСБОТ\"" - a grim-sounding foray into dark ambient electronics. The latest full-length studio album by Won James Won, \""Воиня Везумия\"" is decidedly melodical and song-structured but still as off-kilter as anything in the band's discography. Won James Won are members of ZveZdaZ art-movement. The band is considered as one of the most prolific on Russian underground scene. Their albums were distributed by such well-known underground labels as Cold Spring (U.K.), Amanita (France) and Crucial Blast (US).",Agent,Group,Band

"The 2011 Spanish general election was held on Sunday, 20 November 2011, to elect the 10th Cortes Generales of the Kingdom of Spain. All 350 seats in the Congress of Deputies were up for election, as well as 208 of 266 seats in the Senate. The election was held amid the effects of a harsh financial crisis and José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero's government's perceived failure to cope with the worsening situation of the country's economy resulted in the ruling Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) being swept from power in the worst defeat for a sitting Spanish government since 1982. The PSOE lost roughly 38% of its 2008 vote (4.3 out of 11.3 million) and garnered only 110 seats and 28.8% of the share—its worst ever result in a general election since the Spanish transition to democracy. In contrast, the opposition People's Party (PP) won a record 186 seats and 44.6% of the share, scoring a clean sweep across the country by winning in every region except for Catalonia and the Basque Country. Aside from the PP, the main beneficiaries of the PSOE's debacle were United Left (IU), with its best result since 1996; Union, Progress and Democracy (UPyD), which obtained more than 1 million votes and won 5 seats; Convergence and Union (CiU), which recovered from its negative results in both 2004 and 2008 and, for the first time in democracy, won a general election in Catalonia; and the abertzale left-coalition Amaiur, which won the most seats in the Basque Country region.

"Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967),is a landmark civil rights decision of the United States Supreme Court, which invalidated laws prohibiting interracial marriage. The case was brought by Mildred Loving, a black woman, and Richard Loving, a white man, who had been sentenced to a year in prison in Virginia for marrying each other. Their marriage violated the state's anti-miscegenation statute, the Racial Integrity Act of 1924, which prohibited marriage between people classified as \""white\"" and people classified as \""colored\"". The Supreme Court's unanimous decision determined that this prohibition was unconstitutional, overruling Pace v. Alabama (1883) and ending all race-based legal restrictions on marriage in the United States. The decision was followed by an increase in interracial marriages in the U.S., and is remembered annually on Loving Day, June 12. It has been the subject of three movies and several songs.

The bridge, carrying Interstate 5 on its upper deck and Union Pacific Railroad on its lower deck, was built in 1942 as part of the construction of the Shasta Dam/Shasta Lake reservoir system. The Pit River Bridge was constructed to replace the Lower Pit River Bridge, as the rising waters of the Shasta Lake reservoir would have put the older bridge underwater.

With a height of 500 feet (150 m) above the old Pit River bed, it is structurally the highest double decked bridge in the United States; however, today the bridge sits only about 40 feet (12 m) above the water when Shasta Lake is full. At the time it was built, the highway on the bridge was signed as U.S. Route 99 and the rail line was owned by Southern Pacific.

"Silver scurf is a plant disease that is caused by the plant pathogen Helminthosporium solani. This pathogen is a fungus which is specific to infecting only potato tubers. Silver scurf is a blemish disease, meaning the effect it has on tubers is mostly cosmetic and affects “fresh market, processing and seed tuber potatoes.\"" There are some reports of it affecting development, meaning growth and tuber yield. This is caused by light brown lesions, which in turn change the permeability of tuber skin and then it causes tuber shrinkage and water loss, which finally causes weight loss. The disease has become economically important because silver scurf affected potatoes for processing and direct consumption have been rejected by the industry. The disease cycle can be divided into two stages: field and storage. It is mainly a seed borne disease and the primary source of inoculum is mainly infected potato seed tubers. Symptoms develop and worsen in storage because the conditions are conducive to sporulation. The ideal conditions for the spread of this disease are high temperatures and high humidity. There are also many cultural practices that favor spread and development. Luckily, there are multiple ways to help control the disease.",Species,Eukaryote,Fungus

"Jim Burns is an English poet, writer and magazine editor. He was born in Preston, Lancashire in 1936. Burns was educated at grammar school, worked in mills, and joined the army in 1954. While stationed in Germany, Burns developed a love of jazz and of American writers, accessible through American Forces Network radio and through bookshops stocking new literature for American service personnel. After leaving the army in 1957, he returned to Preston and sought out new writers filtering through to Britain, travelling to Manchester and London to explore those experimental bookshops which stocked the more difficult-to-find ones. Burns had his first poems published in New Voice magazine in 1962, and soon began writing for and about small poetry magazines in a range of publications including The Guardian, Tribune and Ambit. Several books of his poetry have been published, including two volumes of his selected works. In 1964, Burns launched Move, a poetry magazine featuring British and North American writers (including Chris Torrance, Larry Eigner, Lee Harwood, Bill Deemer, Michael Horovitz, Earle Birney, Dave Cunliffe and Tina Morris) which ran for eight issues (it folded in 1968): it was part of the British poetry revival, lauded beyond the traditional audience of middle class intellectuals in London, Oxford and Cambridge. Burns contributed poetry to many other magazines, and literary reviews and articles to The Guardian, Tribune and New Society. Perhaps his most important contributions were bringing the world of small poetry magazines to a wider audience through regular reviews and columns, and in particular spreading his knowledge of those lesser known North American writers who he felt deserved greater attention. When the editor of Palantir poetry magazine (published through Preston Polytechnic) stepped down, Burns took over from issue number 3 in May 1976; this gave him the opportunity to direct attention to writers he felt deserved more support. Working on Palantir through to the final (23rd) issue in 1983, he included work from many leading poets (for example, Gael Turnbull, Wes Magee and Edwin Brock), and wrote about the lesser known beat poets. As of 2014, Burns continues to write on jazz, literature and politics, and has published several essay collections including Beats, Bohemians & Intellectuals (Trent Books, 2000), Radicals, Beats & Beboppers (Penniless Press, 2011) and Artists, Beats & Cool Cats (Penniless Press, 2014).",Agent,Writer,Poet

It is a small salamander endemic to the Pacific Northwest from Northern California to Northern Oregon. It is one of four species of Rhyacotriton, along with R. cascadae, R. kezeri and R. olympicus. All species of Rhyacotriton are small, with their body lengths being less than 5 inches. The species reproduces annually, with an extended courtship and egg-laying period. The time it takes from oviposition to reach sexual maturity ranges from five to eight years, making the generation interval rather long. The larval stage, from hatching to metamorphosis, lasts 2.0-2.5 yr, with females requiring another 1.5–2.0 yr until they can first breed. They reach sexual maturity 1.0-1.5 yr after metamorphosis which occurs between 4.5 and 5.0 yr. This species feeds on small insects and spiders.

"Myles Coverdale, first name also spelt Miles (1488 – 20 January 1569), was an English ecclesiastical reformer chiefly known as a Bible translator, preacher and, briefly, Bishop of Exeter (1551-1553). Regarding his probable birth county, Daniell cites John Bale, author of a sixteenth century scriptorium, giving it as Yorkshire. Having studied philosophy and theology in Cambridge, Coverdale became an Augustinian friar and went to the house of his order, also in Cambridge. In 1514 John Underwood, a suffragan bishop and archdeacon of Norfolk, ordained him priest in Norwich. He was at the house of the Augustinians when in about 1520, Robert Barnes returned from Louvain to become its prior. In 1535 Coverdale produced the first complete printed translation of the Bible into English. He is also significant because during his long life, he experienced eight decades of crucial importance in religious history. His theological development is a paradigm of the progress of the English Reformation from 1530 to 1552. By the time of his death, he had transitioned into an early Puritan, affiliated to Calvin, yet still advocating the teachings of Augustine.",Agent,Cleric,ChristianBishop

The addition of the three given men raised the standard of the Holt/Norfolk team above the general run of Holt matches. The Holt club declined from the mid-1820s. After that, the centre of county cricket was Norwich and a prominent club was founded there on 11 January 1827.

"Mount Ni (Chinese: 尼山; pinyin: Níshān) is a hill about 30 km (19 mi) to the southeast of the city of Qufu in Shandong Province, China. The hill is culturally significant because it is traditionally regarded as the birthplace of Confucius. It is also the site of a historical temple dedicated to Kong He (alias Shuliang He), the father of Confucius, a Confucian academy (Chinese: 尼山书院; pinyin: Níshān Shūyuàn), and the Yusheng Memorial Temple (Chinese: 毓圣侯祠; pinyin: Yùshèng Hóucí). According to the Han dynasty historian Sima Qian, Confucius parents to be, Kong He and Yan Zheng, went to pray at Mount Ni and Yan Zheng gave birth to Confucius afterwards. The existence of the Temple of Kong He can be traced back to the times of the Northern Wei dynasty (386–535 CE). However, the temple was abandoned and restored repeatedly during the Later Tang, Later Zhou, Song, Jin, and Yuan dynasties. A major reconstruction was undertaken during the Ming dynasty (in 1417 during the reign of the Yongle Emperor). Further expansion of the temple followed during the Qing dynasty. As a result, most of the extent structures of the temple date from either the Ming or the Qing era. The current architectural complex contains three sets of buildings, the Kong He Temple, the Confucian Academy, and the Yusheng Memorial Temple. The Kong He Temple consists of the following halls: the Dacheng Hall (literally \""Hall of Great Achievement\"") dedicated to Confucius, a \""Sleeping Palace\"" dedicated to his wife Qiguan, the Hall of Qi Shengwang and the Sleeping Palace of Qi Shengwang. The Yusheng Memorial Temple is dedicated to mountain spirit of Mount Ni. The Confucian academy contains a lecture hall as well as rooms that were used by the temple management staff.

"NGC 4402 is a relatively near, edge-on spiral galaxy located around 55 million light-years from Earth. It is in the constellation of Virgo within the Virgo Cluster of galaxies. It can be seen when viewing Markarian's Chain. NGC 4402 is roughly 55 thousand light-years wide and is moving away from Earth at around 232 kilometers per second. It is falling into the Virgo galaxy cluster. Images show evidence that the material it once contained to enable it to form stars has been stripped away in a process known as \""ram-pressure stripping\"". This is due to NGC 4402's cooler gasses being struck by hot x-ray gasses coming from the middle of the Virgo galaxy cluster as it moves toward it. The evidence is as follows: \n* There is apparent truncation of the NGC 4402's dust disk. \n* An upward bowing of the dusty disk is apparent. This is caused by a wind of hot gas. \n* Light coming from the far side of the stellar disk appears dim and reddish. This may be because pressure coming from the cluster gas is being forced between the disk and the observer. \n* The bottom part of the main disk shows dust in the form of linear filaments.

"The Gallic Wars were a series of military campaigns waged by the Roman proconsul Julius Caesar against several Gallic tribes. Rome's war against the Gallic tribes lasted from 58 BC to 50 BC and culminated in the decisive Battle of Alesia in 52 BC, in which a complete Roman victory resulted in the expansion of the Roman Republic over the whole of Gaul (mainly present-day France and Belgium). While militarily just as strong as the Romans, the internal division between the Gallic tribes guaranteed an easy victory for Caesar, and Vercingetorix's attempt to unite the Gauls against Roman invasion came too late. The wars paved the way for Julius Caesar to become the sole ruler of the Roman Republic. Although Caesar portrayed this invasion as being a preemptive and defensive action, most historians agree that the wars were fought primarily to boost Caesar's political career and to pay off his massive debts. Still, Gaul was of significant military importance to the Romans, as they had been attacked several times by native tribes both indigenous to Gaul and farther to the north. Conquering Gaul allowed Rome to secure the natural border of the river Rhine. The Gallic Wars are described by Julius Caesar in his book Commentarii de Bello Gallico, which remains the most important historical source regarding the conflict.",Event,SocietalEvent,MilitaryConflict

"The 1936 U.S. Open was the 40th U.S. Open, held June 4–6 at Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield, New Jersey, west of New York City. Tony Manero, a relatively unknown pro from New York playing out of North Carolina, surpassed third round leader Harry Cooper in the final round to claim his only major title. The purse was $5,000 and the winner's share was $1,000. The Upper Course was used for this championship; the Lower Course has been used for all subsequent majors at Baltusrol. Entering the final round, Cooper led Manero by four strokes. Manero's final round 67 (−5) was a course record and gave him a 72-hole total of 282 (−6), two strokes ahead of Cooper, who shot 73 (+1) for 284. Manero's total of 282 set a new U.S. Open tournament record by four shots; the previous record of 286 was set in 1916. Manero was fortunate to even be in the championship, because during sectional qualifying, he needed a chip-in on his final hole just to qualify. His victory was not without controversy. During the final round he was paired with Gene Sarazen, whose tournament scoring record he would break. Sarazen apparently requested the pairing as he believed he could help the notoriously high-strung Manero, a close friend, stay calm. Afterwards a complaint was filed with the USGA alleging that Sarazen was actually giving advice to Manero, a violation of the rules. After a meeting, the USGA ruled that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing, and Manero was allowed to keep the championship. In contrast to the previous year, scoring conditions at the Open were ideal throughout the week. For the tournament, 38 players broke par and the scoring average was 76.04, both numbers setting U.S. Open records. Chuck Kocsis finished as low amateur in a tie for 14th place.

"Akebono Tarō (曙 太郎 Akebono Tarō, born 8 May 1969 as Chadwick Haheo Rowan) is an American-born professional wrestler and former sumo wrestler from Waimānalo, Hawaii. Joining the professional sport in Japan in 1988, he was trained by pioneering Hawaiian sumo wrestler Takamiyama and rose swiftly up the rankings, reaching the top division in 1990. After two consecutive yusho or tournament championships in November 1992 and January 1993 he made history by becoming the first non-Japanese-born wrestler ever to reach yokozuna, the highest rank in sumo. One of the tallest and heaviest wrestlers ever, Akebono's rivalry with the young Japanese hopefuls, Takanohana and Wakanohana, was a big factor in the increased popularity of sumo at tournament venues and on TV in the early 1990s. During his eight years at the yokozuna rank, Akebono won a further eight tournament championships, for a career total of eleven, and was a runner-up on thirteen other occasions, despite suffering several serious injuries. Although his rival yokozuna Takanohana won more tournaments in this period, their individual head-to-heads remained very close.

"The Orbiting Frog Otolith (OFO) was a NASA space program which resulted in the successful launch in 1970 of the Orbiting Frog Otolith spacecraft (OFO-A mission), sending two bullfrogs into orbit for the study of weightlessness. The name, derived through common use, was a functional description of the biological experiment carried by the satellite. Otolith referred to the frog's inner-ear balance mechanism. The Orbiting Frog Otolith Program was a part of the research program of NASA's Office of Advanced Research and Technology (OART). One of the goals of the OART was to study vestibular organ function in space and on the Earth. The OFO experiment was designed to allow researchers to collect neurophysiological data on the response of the otolith to prolonged periods of weightlessness. The otolith is a part of the inner ear that is associated with equilibrium control: acceleration with respect to gravity as its primary sensory input. The Frog Otolith Experiment (FOE) was developed by Dr. Torquato Gualtierotti of the University of Milan, Italy, when he was assigned to the Ames Research Center as a resident Research Associate sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences. The experiment was designed to study the adaptability of the otolith to sustained weightlessness, to provide information for manned space flight. Originally planned in 1966 to be included on an early Apollo mission, the experiment was deferred when that mission was canceled. In late 1967 authorization was given to orbit the FOE when a supporting spacecraft could be designed. The project, part of NASA's Human Factor Systems program, was officially designated \""OFO\"" in 1968. After a series of delays, OFO was orbited 9 November 1970. After the successful OFO-A mission in 1970, interest in the research continued. A project called Vestibular Function Research was initiated in 1975 to fly a vestibular experiment in an Earth-orbiting spacecraft. This flight project was eventually discontinued, but a number of ground studies were conducted. The research has given rise to several very useful offshoots, including the ground-based Vestibular Research Facility located at ARC.

The school campus was built without any government funding, with many of the construction workers being parents of future students, who volunteered their time and resources to bring the school into existence. Calvin Christian School is named after the Protestant reformer John Calvin.

"George Adams (August 1, 1784 – August 14, 1844) was an American lawyer and political figure who served in Kentucky and, later, Mississippi state offices and, was later a United States attorney and federal judge. George Adams was born in the Virginia settlement of Lynchburg, two years before its establishment as a chartered community in 1786. He moved to Frankfort, the capital of the neighboring Commonwealth of Kentucky, where he read law and maintained a private practice from 1810 to 1825, while serving in the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1810–11 and, again, in 1814. In 1825, he moved south, crossing Virginia and Tennessee, to settle in Mississippi's oldest city, Natchez, which is connected to Tennessee's capital, Nashville, via the region's best-known land transportation route, the Natchez Trace. Following private law practice in Natchez from 1825 to 1827, he served as the state's attorney general in 1828–29, returning to his Natchez practice in 1829–30.

"The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band (WCPAEB) was an American psychedelic rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1965. The group created music that possessed an eerie, and at times sinister, atmosphere, and contained material that was bluntly political, childlike, and bizarre. Representing different musical backgrounds among band members, the group, at times, resembled a traditional Byrds-esque folk rock ensemble, but the WCPAEB also, within the same body of work, recorded avant-garde music marked by multi-layered vocal harmonies. Aspiring musician and scenester Bob Markley managed to join the group the Laughing Wind in exchange for his connections in the music industry and substantial bankroll. The original five-piece line-up consisted of Michael Lloyd (rhythm guitar, vocals), Shaun Harris (bass guitar, vocals, Danny Harris (lead guitar, vocals), John Ware (drums), and Markley (tambourine, vocals). Although Markley possessed the least musical talent, his expertise in law enabled him to assume control of the group's name and publishing, which generated a divide in the WCPAEB's creative mindset. The band debuted with the album Volume One in 1966 on the small FiFo record label. In the early years of the group, much was made of the WCPAEB's elaborate psychedelic light shows, which became the focal point of their live performances in Los Angeles. Following the release of Volume One, the WCPAEB signed with Reprise Records, recording three albums with the company, including arguably their most accomplished work Volume 3: A Child's Guide to Good and Evil in 1968. Two additional albums, Where's My Daddy? and Markley A Group, were distributed on independent labels before the group disbanded in 1970.",Agent,Group,Band

Nanyang Siang Pau is currently one of oldest Chinese-language newspapers in the country, with only Kwong Wah Yit Poh being the longest-running Malaysia's Chinese newspaper.

"4949 Akasofu, provisional designation 1988 WE, is a stony Flora asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 5 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Japanese amateur astronomer Takuo Kojima at the YGCO Chiyoda Station in Japan on 29 November 1988. The S-type asteroid is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.9–2.7 AU once every 3 years and 5 months (1,251 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.17 and an inclination of 5 degrees with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. The first precovery was obtained at the Purple Mountain Observatory in 1978, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 10 years prior to its discovery. According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's space-based Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 4.5 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.32, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an intermediate albedo of 0.24 – which derives from 8 Flora, the largest member and namesake of this orbital family – and calculates a diameter of 5.7 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 13.4. In October 2005, a rotational light-curve of this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations made by David Higgins at Hunters Hill Observatory, Australia. It showed a rotation period of 2.6798±0.0002 hours with a brightness variation of 0.10 in magnitude (U=3). Observations by Czech astronomer Petr Pravec in March 2007, gave another well-defined and concurring light-curve with a period of 2.6800±0.0003 hours and an amplitude of 0.15 in magnitude (U=3). The minor planet was named in honor of Japanese-born geophysicist Syun-Ichi Akasofu (b. 1930), professor at University of Alaska Fairbanks. He was the director of the International Arctic Research Center from 1998 to 2007, and is known for studies of the aurora borealis.

"Irenaeus (/aɪrəˈniːəs/; Greek: Εἰρηναῖος) (early 2nd century – c. AD 202), also referred to as Saint Irenaeus, was Bishop of Lugdunum in Gaul, then a part of the Roman Empire (now Lyon, France). He was an early Church Father and apologist, and his writings were formative in the early development of Christian theology. A resident of Smyrna, he heard the preaching of St. Polycarp, a disciple of St. John the Evangelist. Irenaeus' best-known book, Adversus Haereses or Against Heresies (c. 180), is a detailed attack on Gnosticism, which was then a serious threat to the Church, and especially on the system of the Gnostic Valentinus. As one of the first great Christian theologians, he emphasized the traditional elements in the Church, especially the episcopate, Scripture, and tradition. Against the Gnostics, who said that they possessed a secret oral tradition from Jesus himself, Irenaeus maintained that the bishops in different cities are known as far back as the Apostles and that the bishops provided the only safe guide to the interpretation of Scripture. His polemical work is credited for laying out the \""orthodoxies of the Christian church, its faith, its preaching and the books that it held as sacred authority.\"" His writings, with those of Clement and Ignatius, are taken as among the earliest signs of the doctrine of the primacy of the Roman see. Irenaeus is the earliest witness to recognition of the canonical character of all four gospels Irenaeus is recognized as a saint in both the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. His feast day is on June 28 in the General Roman Calendar, where it was inserted for the first time in 1920; in 1960 the Roman Catholic Church transferred it to July 3, leaving June 28 for the Vigil of the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, but in 1969 it was returned to June 28, the day of his death.
